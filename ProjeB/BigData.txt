 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

    The house is still standing in East Haverhill Massachusetts where John Greenleaf
    Whittier was born December 17 1807 It was built near the close of the seventeenth
    century by an ancestor of the poet it sheltered several generations of Whittiers in it
    John Greenleaf Whittier lived till his thirtieth year and now it is likely to enjoy a long
    lease of life in association with his name for since his death it has come into the posses
    sion of the Whittier Club of Haverhill and its chief room has been restored to the con
    dition in which it was when the boy was living in it the recollection of whose experience
    inspired that idyl of New England life  SnowBound

    It is to  SnowBound  that one resorts for the most natural and delightful narrative of
    the associations amongst which Whittier passed his boyhood His family held to the
    tenets of the Friends and the discipline of that society in connection with the somewhat
    rigorous exactions of country life in New England in the early part of the century deter
    mined the character of the formal education which he received In later life he was
    wont to refer to the journals of Friends which he found in the scanty library in his
    fathers house as forming a large part of his reading in boyhood He steeped his mind
    with their thoughts and learned to love their authors for their unconscious saintliness
    There were not more than thirty volumes on the shelves and with a passion for reading
    he read them over and over One of these books however was the Bible and he possessed
    himself of its contents not only becoming familiar with the text but penetrated by the
    spirit Wheu he began to write his practice pieces were very largely paraphrases of
    scriptural themes and throughout his poetry allusions to Biblical characters and passages
    fall as naturally from his lips as allusions to Greek or Roman literature and history
    from the lips of Milton

    Of regular schooling he had what the neighborhood could give a few weeks each win
    ter in the district sqhool and when he was nineteen a little more than a year in an
    academy just started in Haverhill In  SnowBound  he has drawn the portrait of one
    of his teachers at the district school and his poem  To My Old Schoolmaster  commem
    orates another Joshua Coffin with whom he preserved a strong friendship in his
    manhood when they were engaged in the same great cause of the abolition of human
    slavery These teachers who according to the old New England custom lived in turn
    with the families of their pupils brought into the Whittier household other reading than
    strictly religious books and Coffin especially rendered the boy a great service in intro
    ducing him to a knowledge of Burns whose poems he read aloud once as the family sat
    by the fireside in the evening The boy of fourteen was entranced  it was the voice of
    poetry speaking directly to the ear of poetry and the newcomer recognized in an instant
    the prophet whose mantle he was to wear Coffin was struck with the effect on his
    listener and left the book with him In one of his best known poems written a generation
    later when receiving a sprig of heather in bloom Whittier records his indebtedness to
    Burns To use his own expression the older poet woke the younger He had been
    dreaming of Indians much as a young Scotsman might have pleased his imagination by
    picturing border chieftains He said himself looking back with amusement to his poem
    of  Mogg Megone  it suggests the idea of a big Indian in his war paint strutting about
    in Sir Walter Scotts plaid But except for one or two intentional imitations Burns
    influence over Whittier was summed up in that sudden illumination which showed him
    not indeed the beauty of nature and the worth of man  the knowledge of these was a
    birthright  but what poetry could do in transfiguring both

    The home life which the boy led aside from the conscious or unconscious schooliag

    which he found iu books was one of many haidships but within the sanctuary of a
    gracious and dignified home The secluded valley in which he lived was three miles from
    the nearest village  from the date of the erection of the homestead till now no neighbors
    roof has been in sight The outdoor life was that of a farmer with cattle tempered
    indeed in the short summer by the kindly gifts of nature so happily shown in the poem of
    the  Barefoot Boy but for the most part a life of toil and endurance which left its
    marks indelibly in the shattered constitution of the poet Twice a week the family drove
    to a Friends meeting at Amesbury eight miles distant and in winter without warm
    wraps or protecting robes The old barn built before that celebrated in  SnowBound
    had no doors and the winter snows drifted upon its floor for neither beasts nor men
    in the custom of the time were expected to resist cold except by their native vigor
    Whittiers companions of his own age were a brother and two sisters one of whom
    Elizabeth Whittier was his nearest associate for the better part of his life and the house
    hold held also that figure so beautiful and helpful in many families an Aunt Mercy as
    also a lively adventurous bachelor Uncle Moses The father of the house as we are
    told was a man of few words  the mother whose life was spared till that happy time
    when mother and son change places in caretaking had a rarely refined nature in which
    the Quaker graces of calmness and order were developed into a noble beauty of living

    The appendix to Whittiers Poetical Works contains a few out of a large number of
    poems written by him when he was a schoolboy They display as indeed did most of
    his writing for a few years to come little more than a versifying facility and a certain
    sense of correct form as copied from correct but rather lifeless models They were for
    all that witnesses to the intellectual activity of a rudely trained boy and showed that
    his mind was intent on high oftentimes poetic themes His mother and his sister Mary
    encouraged him but his father a hardheaded hardworking farmer of sound judgment
    and independent habits of thinking was too severely aware of the straitened condition of
    the family to think of anything else for his son than a life of toil like his own Mary
    Whittier with a sisters pride sent one of her brothers poems unknown to the author
    to the Free Press  of Newburyport a new paper lately started which commended itself
    by its tone to the Quaker Whittier so that he had subscribed to it The poem was
    printed and the first that the poet knew of it was when he caught the paper from the
    postman riding by the field where he and his father were working It was such a mo
    ment as comes to a young poet believing in himself and having that aspiration for
    recognition which is one of the holiest as it is one of the subtlest elements in the poetic
    constitution The poem was followed by another which the author himself sent Its
    acceptance was followed by an unheralded visit by the editor who had learned that the
    writer was scarcely more than a boy and whose own taste in poetry led him to set a high
    value on this versification of scripture for the poem was that preserved under the title
    The Deity

    Whittier was at work in the fields when the editor himself a young man called He
    held back but was induced by his sister to make himself presentable and come in to see
    the visitor It was one of those first encounters which in the history of notable men are
    charged with most interesting potentialities Garrison for he was the editor had not yet
    done more than take the first step on his thorny path to greatness and Whittier was still
    working in the fields though harboring poetic visitants Garrison was but a few years
    older and in later life those few years counted nothing but now they were enough to
    lead him to take the tone of an adviser and both to Greenleaf and his father who entered
    the room he spoke of the promise of the youth and the importance of his acquiring an
    academic education

    It was against the more rigorous interpretation of the Friends doctrine that literary
    culture should be made an end and the notion that the boy should be sent to an academy
    was not encouraged  but a few months later Garrison having left Newburyport for Bos
    ton and Whittier making a new connection with the Haverhill  Gazette the editor of that
    paper Mr A W Thayer gave the same advice and pressed the consideration that a new
    academy was shortly to be opened in Haverhill He offered the boy a home in his own

    family and the father now consented moved also by the doubt if his son could stand tlie
    physical strain of farm work He had no money however to spare and the student
    must earn his own living This he did by making a cheap kind of slipper and devoted
    himself so faithfully to the industry in the few months intervening between the decision
    and the opening of the academy in May 187 that he earned enough to pay his expenses
    there for a term of six months  He calculated so closely every item of expense says
    his biographer that he knew before the beginning of the term that he would have
    twentyfive cents to spare at its close and he actually had this sum of money in his pocket
    when his half year of study was over It was the rule of his whole life never to buy
    anything until he had the money in hand to pay for it and although liis income was small
    and uncertain until past middle life he was never in debt

    By teaching a district school a few weeks and aiding a merchant with bookkeeping he
    was enabled to make out a full year of study and meantime continued to write both verse
    and prose for the newspapers By this means he paved the way for an invitation when
    he was twentyone years of age to enter the printing office in Boston of the Colliers
    father and son who published two weekly papers and a magazine One of the weeklies
    was a political journal The Manufacturer the other a paper of reform and humani
    tarianism called  The Philanthropist Whittier had editorial charge of the former and
    occupied himself with writing papers on temperance and the tariff of which he was an
    ardent advocate and with verses and tales It was not altogether a congenial relation in
    which he found himself though the occupation was one to which he was to turn naturally
    for some time to come for selfsupport  he remained with the Colliers for a year and a
    half and then returned to his fathers farm with between four and five hundred dollars
    the savinos of half his salary This he devoted to freeing the farm from the incumbrance
    of a mortgage and himself took charge of the farm for his father was rapidly failing m

    health i   i

    The death of his father in June 1830 while it set him free from his father s occupa
    tion made it still more imperative for him to earn his living since the care of the family
    fell upon him He had been using his pen and studying meanwhile and his verses were
    bringing him acquaintances and friends Through one of these the brilliant George D
    Prentice he was induced to take up editorial work again in Hartford but after a deter
    mined effort it became clear that his health was too fragile to permit him to devote
    himself to the exacting work of editing a journal and in January 1832 he returned to
    his home Just at this time he published his first book a mere pamphlet of twentyeight
    octavo pages containing a poem of New England legendary life entitled
    He had contributed besides more than a hundred poems in the three years since leaving
    the academy and had written many more But though thus active with his pen his
    strongest ambition it may be said was at this time in the direction of politics For the
    next four years he remained on the farm at Haverhill and when in April 1836 the farm
    was sold he removed with his mother and sister to the village of Amesbury chiefly that they
    mitrht be nearer the Friends meeting but also that Whittier might be more in the centre
    of things In his seclusion at East Haverhill he had eagerly watched the course of public
    events He was a great admirer of Henry Clay and a determined opponent of Jackson
    With his engaging character his intellectual readiness and that political instinct which
    never deserted him he was rapidly coming into public notice in his district and his own
    desire for serving in office drew him on To be a member of Congress he must be twenty
    five years old and at the election which was to occur just before his birthday there were
    many indications that he would be the nominee of his party This was at the end of 1832
    but before the next election occurred there was a grave obstacle created by Whittier
    himself and thenceforward through the years when he would naturally engage in public
    life he was practically disbarred

    It was not the precariousness of his health which kept Whittier out of active politics
    thougli this was a strong reason for avoiding tlie stress and strain of a public life but the
    decision which led him to enlist in an unpopular cause In November 1831 he had
    published his poem  To William Lloyd Garrison which introduces the section AutiSlavery



    JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER



    Poems in this collection It intimates a personal influence under which with a moral
    nature fortified by great political insight he began to consider seriously the movement for
    the abolition of slavery which was making itself evident here and there As a specific
    result of this study he wrote in the spring of 1833 the pamphlet
    and published it at liis own expense It was a piece of writing compact with carefully
    gathered facts and logical deduction and earnest with the rhetoric of personal conviction
    Every sentence was an arraignment of slavery and a blow at his own chances of political
    office The performance was in answer to the appeal of his own truthful nature and it
    was a deliberate act of renunciation

    Now also began at first with remote suggestions as in Toussaint LOuverture then
    nearer and nearer as he sings his tribute to the men of his day known or unknown who
    had been champions of freedom Storrs Shipley Torrey those bursts of passionate verse
    which were the vent of his soul overburdened with a sense of the deep wrong committed
    against God and man by the persistency of African slavery in the United States In the
    years immediately following his decision to cast in his lot with the small band of despised
    antislavery agitators almost all of the poems which he wrote were of two sorts either
    breathings of a spirit craving close communion with God as in his hymns his lines on
    The Call of the Christian  The Female Martyr and other poems or fiery scarcecon
    trolled outbursts of feeling upon the evils of slavery and vials of wratli poured out on
    those who aided and abetted tlie monstrous wrong Such poems as The Slave Ships
    The Hunters of Men  Stanzas for the Times  Clerical Oppressors
    derive their power not from their poetic spirit and form so much
    as from the righteous indignation the pity the overcharged feeling which crowd them
    And if in the years before Whittier
    drawn notice by the gentle spirit which suffused them now his loud cry violent and
    tempestuous broke upon the ear with a harshness and yet an insistent fervor which com
    pelled men to listen It is indeed a striking phenomenon in poetic growth wliich one
    s compositions and casts bis eye down a chronolog
    ical list of his poems Up to the date of his enlistment in the ranks of the antislavery
    army his ambition had been divided between literature and politics with a taste in verse
    which was harmonious and an execution which was not wanting in melody yet had no
    remarkable note After he stepped into the ranks a great change came over his spirit
    He rushed into verse in a tumultuous fashion careless of the form eager only to utter
    the message which half choked him with its violence There was a fierce note to his
    poetry rough but tremendously earnest This was the first effect such a troubling of
    the waters as gave a somewhat turbid aspect to the stream and for a while his verse was
    very largely declamatory rhymed polemics
    But such poems as  Expostulation beginning

    Our fellowcountrymen in chains

    were to people then living scarcely so much poems as they were sounds of a great trumpet
    which were heard not for their musical sonancebut for their power to stir the blood and
    Whittier though living almost in seclusion became a name of note to many who would
    scarcely have known of him had he been a mere legislator or smoothsinging verse maker
    He was recognized by the antislavery leaders as one of themselves and this not only
    because of his powerful speech in song but because on closer acquaintance he proved to
    be a most sagacious and wise reader of men and affairs His own neighbors quickly
    learned this quality in him He was sent to the legislature in 1835 and reelected in
    1836 but his frail health made it impossible for him to continue in this service Never
    theless he wielded political power with great skill aside from political office He was
    indefatigable in accomplishing political ends through political men No important
    nominations were made in his district without a preliminary conference with him and
    more than once he compelled unwilling representatives to work for the great ends he had
    in view It may be said here that though a steadfast leader in the antislavery cause he
    differed from some of his associates both now and throughout his life in setting a high



    BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH xv

    value upon existing political organizations  From first to last says his biographer
    he refused to couie out from his party until he had done all that could be done to induce
    and Whittier himself in an article written about this
    time exclaims  What an absurdity is moral action apart from political   meaning of
    course when dealing with those subjects which demand political action Once more in a
    letter written to the antiTexas convention of 1845 he said that though as an abolitionist
    he was no blind worshiper of the Union he saw nothing to be gained by an effort neces
    sarily limited and futile to dissolve it The moral and political power requisite for
    dissolving the Union could far more easily abolish every vestige of slavery

    We have anticipated a little in these comments the strict order of Whittier
    1836 was published the first boimd volume of his verse It was confined to his poem
    Mogg Megone which he had before printed in the  New England Magazine It may
    s poetic mind before the great change came
    over it of which we have spoken and he was himself later so aware of its lack of genuine
    life that in collecting finally his writings he buried this so far as he could in the fine type
    of an appendix  but at the end of 1837 Isaac Knapp publisher of the
    Garrison
    consulting the poet issued a volume of over a hundred pages entitled  Poems written
    durino the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States between the Years
    1830 and 1838 By John G Whittier This was the first collection of his miscellaneous
    poems and a year later another volume was issued by Joseph Healy the financial agent
    of the AntiSlavery Society of Pennsylvania Meanwhile Whittier had been staying
    awhile in Philadelphia engaged in editing the  Pennsylvania Freeman It was during
    this time that Pennsylvania Hall was burnt by a mob enraged at the gathering there of an
    antislavery convention Besides his work on the paper which was frequently interrupted
    bv ill health he devoted himself in other ways to the promotion of the cause in which he
    was so ardently involved but early in 1840 he found it imperative to give up all this work
    and retire to his home in Amesbury

    From this time forward he made no attempt to engage in any occupation which did not
    comport with a quiet life in his own home except that for a few months in 1844 he
    resided in Lowell editing the  Middlesex Standard He wrote much for the papers
    and the poetic stream also flowed with greater freedom and it may be said clearness
    He contributed a number of poems to the  Democratic Review  and other periodicals
    and in 1843 the firm of W D Ticknor published  Lays of my Home and Other Poems
    the first book from which Whittier received any remuneration The struggle for main
    tenance through these years was somewhat severe but in January 1847 h2 formed a
    connection which was not only to afford him a more liberal support but was to give him a
    most favorable outlet for his writings both prose and verse

    It had been decided by the American and Foreign AntiSlavery Society to establish a
    weekly paper in Washington and the editorial charge was committed to Dr Gamaliel
    Bailey an intrepid and able man of experience The paper was named  The National
    Era and Whittier was invited to become a regular contributor editorial and otherwise
    but not required to do his work away from home The paper as is well known was the
    s Cabin
    able as to make it a source of profit to its conductors as early as by the end of the first
    year From 1847 till 1860 Whittier made this paper the chief vehicle of his writings
    contributing not only poems but reviews of contemporary literature editorial articles
    Leaves from
    Margaret Smith

    In 1849 B B Mussey  Co of Boston brought out a comprehensive collection of
    Whittiers Poems in a dignified octavo volume illustrated with designs by Hammatt
    Billings It was a venture made quite as much on friendly as on commercial grounds
    Mr Mussey was a cordial supporter of the antislavery cause and had a great admiration
    for Whittier
    his generous act met with an agreeable reward Its success was a testimony to the



    JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER



    repute in which Whittier was now held At the same time his publishers Messrs Ticknor
    Fields were in negotiation with him for anew volume and m 1850 appeared bongs ot
    Labor and Other Poems  i i n xu

    These two volumes which gathered the fruit of twenty years show unmistakably the
    s poetic power With the establishment of his antislavery
    convictions into firm working principles the maturing of his experience the enlarge
    ment of his political vision and the increase in his friendship there had come also a
    strengthening of his hand in the use of his pen and a finer use because more clear and
    restrained of his poetic voice Moreover the religious feeling which was seen in his
    earlier life and put to the test by closer association with men had deepened into a
    serene confidence in God which pervaded his life and sustained him against all the shock
    of a disappointing age Moreover his eye and ear were in harmony with nature and
    more and more he found not only an escape to nature as a relief from the world but a
    positive enioyment in the field of beauty Poetry once a literary exercise then a chan
    nel for the relief of a mind overburdened with its sense of an unconquered evil was now
    become the full free expression of a nature broadening under the thought ot God
    delighting in response to the world of beauty strong and secure m a great purpose ot
    hunfanity It was his natural voice which formerly broke under the strain of a chang
    ing constitution but now was pure sweet and farcarrying obeying a trained impulse and
    resonant vith a full force    j Tin i

    The establishment of  The Atlantic Monthly
    tiers poetic productiveness Here was a singular illustration of the gro wtli in the commun
    ity about him of a spirit quite in agreement with his own personality Opposition to sla
    very lay at the base of the origin of the magazine and yet in the minds of its projectors
    this political bond was to unite men of letters and not simply antagonists of slavery Ihe
    Atlantic
    sively devoted to an antislavery crusade Indeed it would almost seem as if this specific
    purpose of the magazine was almost lost sight of at first m the richness and abundance
    oi general literature which it immediately stimulated It is easy now to see how natural
    and congenial a medium this was for Whittiers verse In subjecting his political and
    literary Imbition to a great moral purpose so that he could no longer hope for political
    official power and in his own words

    Had left the Muses
    The crank of an opinion mill
    Making his rustic reed of song
    A weapon in the war with wrong
    Yoking his fancy to the breakingplough

    That beamdeep turned the soil for truth to spring and grow

    in doino this though it cost him a struggle be had fulfilled the true saying that to save
    Ls life one mustlose it He had given up the name and place of a poll ical magnate
    but he had secured the more impregnable position of the power be nnd  throne in poli
    tics and in place of a smooth versifier holding the attention of those with wlom poetry
    was a plaything he had become one of the few imperative voices of song and had taken
    Ts place as oife of the necessary men in the group of men of letters who now came to
    gether to represent the highest force in American literature

    For it is to be observed that Whittier was now no longer regarded as only the singer
    of spirited sons flying with all their winged power straight at the enemy as they sped
    Lorn a bow held baif Apollo The passion which he had sliwn m his Pol v
    had awakened his hole nature and his poems on whatever theme came roni a na
    which had been developed in all its powers by this commanding purpose fjevertheless

    association with the other great writers of the day was consonant with if not the cause ot

    in State Street     j

    The war for the Union naturally found Whittier strongly stirred and more than ever
    watchful of the great issue which throughout his manhood has been constantly before his
    eves and his triumphant  Laus Deo  is as it were the Nunc Dimittis of this modern pro
    phet and servant of the Lord But Whittier was a Quaker not in any conventional
    sense but by birthright conviction and growing consciousness of communion with God
    Though he wrote such a stirring ballad therefore as  Barbara Frietchie he wrote also
    the lines addressed to his fellowbelievers

    The levelled gun the battle brand
    We may not take

    But calmly loyal we can stand
    And suffer with our suffering land
    For conscience sake

    It is interesting also to observe how in this time of stress and pain he escaped to the
    calm solace of nature His poem  The Battle Autumn of 1862 records this emotion
    specifically but more than one poem in the group In War Time bears testimony to this
    sentiment Meanwhile other poems written during the years 18611865 illustrate the
    longing of Whittiers nature for relief from the terrible knowledge of human strife a
    longing definitely expressed by him in the prelusive address to William Bradford the
    Quaker painter prefacing  Amy Wentworth in which he says

    We doomed to watch a strife we may not share
    With other weapons than the patriots prayer
    Yet owning with full hearts and moistened eyes
    The awful beauty of selfsacrifice
    And wrung by keenest sympathy for all
    Who give their loved ones for the living waU
    iwixt law and treason  in this evil day
    May haply find through automatic play
    Of pen and pencil solace to our pain
    And hearten others with the strength we gain

    Something of the same note is struck in the introduction to  The Countess But be
    fore the war closed Whittier met with a personal loss which meant much to him every
    way His sister Elizabeth as we have seen had been his closest companion his most in
    timate acquaintance He had shared his life with her in no light sense and now he was
    to see the flame of that life flicker and at last expire in the early fall of 1864 The
    first poem after her death  The Vanishers in its theme its faint note as of a bird
    calling from the wood is singularly sweet both as a sign of the return of the poet to
    the world after his flight from it in sympathy and imagination with the retreating spirit
    of his sister and as a prophecy of the character of so large a part of Whittiers poetry
    from this time forward  The Eternal Goodness written a twelvemonth later may
    be said more positively than any other poem to contain Whittiers creed and the fullness
    of faith which characterizes it found free and cheerful expression again and again

    Yet another poem which immediately followed it is significant not only by its repetition
    of his note of spiritual trust but by its strong witness to the sane human quality of
    Whittiers genius  SnowBound simple and radiant as it is with human life is also the
    reflection of a mind equally at home in spiritual realities It may fairly be said to sum
    up Whittiers personal experience and faith and yet so absolutely free is it from egotism
    that it has taken its place as the representative poem of New England country life quite
    as surely as Burns  The Cotters Saturday Night  expresses one large phase of Scot
    tish life

    The success which attended  SnowBound  was immediate and the result was such as
    to put Whittier at once beyond the caprices of fortune and to give him so firm a place in

    the aifectioiis of his countrymen as to complete as it were the years of his struggle and
    his patient endurance There is something almost dramatic in the appearance of this
    poem The war was over  the end of that long contest in which Whittier physically
    weak but spiritually strong had been a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by
    night What was the force which had been too mighty for a great entrenched wrong
    With no conscious purpose but in the simple delight of poetry Whittier sang this
    winter idyl of the North and one now sees how it imprisons the light which shatters the
    evil for it is an epitome of homely work and a family life lived in the eye of God
    duty keeping pace with all and the whole issuing in that large hope

    Life greatens in these later years
    The centurys aloe flowers today

    The history of Whittiers life after this date is written in his poems The outward
    adventure was slight enough He divided his year between the Amesbury home and
    that which he established with other kinsfolk at Oak Knoll in Danvers In the summer
    time he was wont to seek the mountains of New Hampshire or the nearer beaches that
    stretch from Newburyport to Portsmouth The scenes thus familiar to him were trans
    lated by him into song Human life blended with the forms of nature and he made this
    whole region as distinctively his poetic field as Wordsworth made the Lake district of
    Cumberland or as Irving made the banks of the Hudson In such a group as  The
    Tent on the Beach in Among the Hills The Witch of Wenham Sunset on the
    Bearcamp  The Seeking of the Waterfall  How the Women went from Dover
    The Homestead and many others he records the delight which he took in nature and
    especially in the human associations with nature

    The Tent on the Beach  again illustrates the personal attachments which he formed
    and which constituted so large an element in the last thirty years of his life In actual
    contact and in the friendships formed through books one may read the largeness of
    Whittiers svmpathy with his fellows and the warmth of his generous nature Such
    poems as thefrequent ones commemorating Garrison Sumner Longfellow Lowell Holmes
    the Fieldss Mrs Child the Spoffords Stedman Barnard Bayard Taylor Weld and
    others illustrates the range of his friendship  but the poems also which bear the names of
    Tilden Mulford Thiers Halleck Agassiz Garibaldi illustrate likewise a strong sense of
    the lives of men who perhaps never came within the scope of personal acquaintance

    Nor was it only through human lives that he touched the world about him His bio
    grapher bears witness to the assiduity with which he compensated in later years for the
    restrictions imposed by necessity on his education in earlier years He became a great
    and discursive reader and his poems especially after  SnowBound contain many
    proofs of this both in the suggestions which gave rise to them and in the allusions which
    they contain Northern literature is reflected in The Dole of Jarl Thorkell  King
    Volmer and Elsie The Brown Dwarf of Rligen and others Eastern life and
    religion reappear in Oriental Maxims Hymns of the Brahmo Somaj The Brew
    ing of Soma  Giving and Taking and many more and history especially that in
    volved with his own religious faith gave opportunity for  The King s Missive St
    Gregorys Guest  Banished from Massachusetts  The Two Elizabeths  The Penn
    sylvania Pilgrim i  i  i p j

    Yet as we suggested above the most constant strain after all was that which touncl
    so full expression in  The Eternal Goodness So pervasive in Whittiers mind was this
    thought of God that it did not so much seek occasion for formal utterance as it used with
    the naturalness of breathing such opportunities as arose touching with light one theme
    after another and forming indeed the last whispered voice heard from his lips  Love
    to all the world e   ve

    It was a serene life of the spirit which Whittier led m the closing years ot his lire
    and he was secure in friendship and the shelter of home He read he saw his neighbors
    and friends he wrote letters he took the liveliest interest in current affairs and was

    indeed an elector on the Republican side in the great Presidential canvass which re
    sulted in the first election of Cleveland He was much sought for occasional poems and
    he complied with these requests from time to time as in his  Centennial Hymn  In
    the Old South  The Bartholdi Statue  One of the Signers and  Haverhill   but
    he was quite as likely to take bint from an occasion without the asking Yet all this
    time he was assailed by infirmities which would have shaken the serenity of most He

    life

    at white lieat and of course lacking the finish and careful wordselection which re
    flection and patient brooding over them might have given Such as they are they
    belong to the history of the AntiSlavery movement and may seive as waymarks
    of its progress If their language at times seems severe and harsh the monstrous
    wrong of Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse if any is needed In at
    tacking it ve did not measure our words  It is said Garrison  a waste of
    politeness to be courteous to the devil But in truth the contest was in a great
    measure an impersonal one  hatred of slavery and not of slavemasters

    No common wrong provoked our zeal
    The silken gauntlet which is thrown
    In such a quarrel rings like steel

    Even Thomas Jefferson in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the  Notes on
    Virginia says   It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the subject of
    Slavery

    After the great contest was over no class of the American people were more
    ready with kind words and deprecation of harsh retaliation to welcome back the
    revolted States than the Abolitionists  and none have since more heartily rejoiced
    at the fast increasing prosperity of the South

    Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my writings I
    leave this edition with the public It contains all that I care to republish and
    some things which had the matter of choice been left solely to myself I should
    have omitted

    PROEM

    Written to introduce the first general collection of Wliittiers Poems

    I LOVE the old melodious lays
    Which softly melt the ages tluough

    The songs of Spensers golden days

    Arcadian Sidneys silvery phrase
    Sprinkling our noon of time with freshest morning dew

    Yet vainly in my quiet hours
    To breathe their marvellous notes I try

    I feel them as the leaves and flowers

    In silence feel the dewy showers
    And drink with glad still lips the blessing of the sky

    The rigor of a frozen clime
    The harshness of an untaught ear

    The jarring words of one whose rhynit

    Beat often Labors hurried time
    Or Dutys rugged march through storm and strife are here

    Of mystic beauty dreamy grace
    No rounded art the lack supplies

    Unskilled the subtle lines to trace

    Or softer shades of Natures face
    I view her common forms with unanointed eyes

    Nor mine the seerlike power to show
    The secrets of the heart and mind

    To drop the plummetline below

    Our common world of joy and woe
    A more intense despair or brighter hope to find

    Yet here at least an earnest sense
    Of human right and weal is shown

    A hate of tyranny intense

    And hearty in its vehemence
    As if my brothers pain and sorrow were my own

    O Freedom  if to me belong
    Nor mighty Miltons gift divine

    Nor MarveUs wit and graceful song

    Still with a love as deej and strong
    As theirs I lay like them my best gifts on thy shrine

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    THE VAUDOIS TEACHER

    This poem was suggested by the account
    given of the manner in which the Waldenses
    disseminated their principles among the Cath
    olic gentry They gained access to the hoiise
    through their occupation as peddlers of silks
    jewels and trinkets  Having disjiosed of
    some of their goods it is said by a writer
    who quotes the inqiiisitor RaLnerus Sacco
    they caixtiously intimated that they had
    conmsiodities far more valuable than these
    inestimable jewels which they would show if
    they could be protected from the clergy
    They would then give their purchasers a Bible
    or Testament  and thereby many were deluded
    into heresy

    The poem under the title Le Colporteur
    Vaudois was translated into French by Pro
    fessor G de Felice of Montauban and further
    naturalized by Professor Alexandre Rodolphe
    Vinet who quoted it in his lectures on French
    literature afterwards published It became
    familiar in this form to the Waldenses who
    adopted it as a household poem An American
    clergyman J C Fletcher frequently heard it
    when he was a student about the year 1850 in
    the theological seminary at Geneva Switzerland
    but the authorship of the poem was imknown
    to those who used it Twentyfive years later
    Mr Fletcher learning the name of the author
    wrote to the moderator of the Waldensian
    synod at La Tour giving the information At
    the banquet which closed the meeting of the
    synod the moderator announced the fact and
    was instructed in the name of the Waldensian
    church to write to me a letter of thanks My
    letter written in reply was translated into
    Italian and printed throughout Italy

    O LADY fair these silks of mine are beau
    tiful and rare

    The richest web of the Indian loom which
    beautys queen might wear

    And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck
    with whose radiant light they vie

    I have brought them with me a weary
    way  will my gentle lady buy



    The lady smiled on the worn old man

    through the dark and clustering

    curls
    Which veiled her brow as she bent to view

    his silks and glittering pearls
    And she placed their price in the old mans

    hand and lightly turned away
    But she paused at the wanderers earnest

    call   My gentle lady stay

    O lady fair I have yet a gem which a

    purer lustre flings
    Than the diamond flash of the jewelled

    crown on the lofty brow of kings
    A wonderful pearl of exceeding price

    whose virtue shall not decay
    Whose light shall be as a spell to thee and

    a blessing on thy way

    The lady glanced at the mirroring steel

    where her form of grace was seen
    Where her eye shone clear and her dark

    locks waved their clasping pearls

    between
    Bring forth thy pearl of exceeding worth

    thou traveller gray and old
    And name the price of thy precious gem

    and my page shall count thy gold

    The cloud went off from the pilgrims

    brow as a snaall and meagre book
    Unchased with gold or gem of cost from

    his folding robe he took
    Here lady fair is the pearl of price may

    it prove as such to thee
    Nay keep thy gold  I ask it not for the

    word of God is free

    The hoary traveller went his way but the

    gift he left behind
    Hath had its pure and perfect work on

    that highborn maidens mind
    And she hath turned from the pride of sin

    to the lowliness of truth



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And given her Imman heart to God in its
    beautiful hour of youth

    And she hath left the gray old halls where

    an evil faith had power
    The courtly knights of her fathers train

    and the maidens of her bower
    And she hath gone to the Vaudois vales by

    lordly feet imtrod
    Where the poor and needy of earth are

    rich in the perfect love of God



    THE FEMALE MARTYR

    Mary G  aged eighteen a  Sister of

    Charity died in one of our xtlintie cities
    during the prevalence of the Indian cholera
    while in voluntary attendance upon the sick

    Bring out yoiu dead   The midnight

    street
    Heard and gave back the hoarse low

    call
    Harsh fell the tread of hasty feet
    Glanced through the dark the coarse white

    sheet
    Her coffin and her pall
    What  only one   the brutal hackman

    said
    As with an oath he spurned away the dead

    How sunk the inmost hearts of all

    As rolled that deadcart slowly by
    With creaking wheel and harsh hooffall
    The dying turned him to the wall

    To hear it and to die
    Onward it rolled  while oft its driver

    stayed
    And hoarsely clamored  Ho  bring out
    your dead

    It pausefl beside the burialplace

    Toss in your load   and it was done
    With quick hand and averted face
    Hastily to the graves embrace

    They cast them one by one
    Stranger and friend the evil and the just
    Together trodden in the churchyard dust

    And thou yomig martyr  thou wast there

    No whiterobed sisters round thee trod
    Nor holy hymn nor funeral prayer
    Rose through the damp and noisome air

    Giving thee to thy God



    Nor flower nor cross nor hallowed taper

    gave
    Grace to the dead and beauty to the grave

    Yet gentle sufEerer  there shall be

    In every heart of kindly feeling
    A rite as holy paid to thee
    As if beneath the conventtree

    Thy sisterhood were kneeling
    At vesper hours like sorrowing angels

    keeping
    Their tearful watch around thy place of
    sleeping

    For thou wast one in whom the light

    Of Heavens own love was kindled well
    Enduring with a martyrs might
    Through weary day and wakeful night

    Far more than words may tell
    Gentle and meek and lowly and unknown
    Thy mercies measiired by thy God alone

    Where manly hearts were failing where

    The throngf ul street grew foul with death
    O highsouled martyr  thou wast there
    Inhaling from the loathsome air

    Poison with every breath
    Yet shrinking not from offices of dread
    For the wrmig dying and the unconscious
    dead

    And where the sickly taper shed

    Its light through vapors damp confined

    Hushed as a seraphs fell thy tread

    A new Electra by the bed
    Of suffering humankmd

    Pointing the spirit in its dark dismay

    To that pme hope which fadeth not away

    Innocent teacher of the high
    And holy mysteries of Heaven

    How turned to thee each glazing eye

    In mute and awful sympathy
    As thy low prayers were given

    And the oerhovering Spoiler wore the
    while

    An angels features a deliverers smile

    A blessed task  and worthy one

    Who turning from the world as thou
    Befne lifes pathway had begvm
    To leave its springtime flower and sim

    Had sealed her early vow
    Giving to God lier beauty and her youth
    Her pure affections and her guileless truth

    Earth may not claim thee Nothing here
    Conlcl be for thee a meet reward

    Thine is a treasure far more dear

    Eye hath not seen it nor the ear

    The joys prepared the promised bliss

    The fiie of poesy

    These have but frail and fading honors
    thine

    Shall Time mito Eternity consign

    Yea and when thrones shall crumble

    EXTRACT FROM A NEW ENG
    LAND LEGEND

    Originally a part of the authors Moll Pitcher

    How has New Englands romance fled

    Even as a vision of the morning
    Its rites foredone its gviardians dead
    Its priestesses bereft of dread

    Waking the veriest urchins scornmg
    Gone like the Indian wizards yell

    And firedance roimd the magic rock
    Forgotten like the Druids spell

    At moonrise ly his holy oak
    No more along the shadovy glen
    Glide the dim ghosts of murdered men
    No more the miquiet churchyard dead
    Glimpse upward from their turfy bed

    Startling the traveller late and lone
    As on some night of starless weather
    They silently commune together

    Each sitting on his own headstone
    The roofless house decayed deserted
    Its living tenants all departed
    No longer rings with midnight revel
    Of witch or ghost or goblin evil



    No pale blue flame sends out its flashes
    Through creviced roof and shattered

    sashes
    The witchgrass round the hazel spring
    May sharply to the nightair sing
    But there no more shall withered hags
    Refresh at ease their broomstick nags
    Or taste those hazelshadowed waters
    As beverage meet for Satans daughters
    No more their mimic tones be heard
    The mew of cat the chirp of bird
    Shrill blending vdth the hoarser laughter
    Of the fell demon following after
    The cautious goodman nails no more
    A horseshoe on liis outer door
    Lest some unseemly hag should fit
    To his own mouth her bridlebit
    The goodwifes churn no more refuses
    Its wonted culinary uses
    Until with heated needle burned
    The witch has to her place returned
    Our witches are no longer old
    And wrinkled beldames Satansold
    But young and gay and laughmg creatures
    With the hearts simshine ou their fea

    tiues
    Their sorcery  the light which dances
    Where the raised lid imveils its glances
    Or that lowbreathed and gentle tone

    The music of Loves twilight hours
    Soft dreamlike as a fairys moan

    Above her nightly closing flowers
    Sweeter than that which sighed of yore
    Along the charmed Ausonian shore
    Even she om own weird heroine
    Sole Pythoness of ancient Lynn

    Sleeps calmly where the living laid
    her
    And the mde realm of sorcery
    Left by its latest mistress free

    Hath foimd no gray and skilled invader
    So perished Albions  glammarye

    With him in Melrose Abbey sleeping
    His charmed torch beside his knee
    That even the dead himself might see

    The magic scroll within his keeping
    And now our modern Yankee sees
    Nor omens spells nor mysteries
    And naught above below around
    Of life or death of sight or sound

    Whateer its nature form or look
    Excites his terror or surprise
    All seeming to his knowing eyes

    THE DEMON OF THE STUDY

    The Browiiie sits in the Scotchmans room
    And eats his meat and tbinks his ale

    And beats the maid with her miused broom
    And the lazy lout with his idle fiail

    But he sweeps the floor and threshes the
    corn

    And hies him away ere the break of dawn

    The shade of Denmark fled from the sim
    And the Cocklane ghost from the barn
    loft cheer

    The fiend of Faust was a faithful one
    Agripjjas demon wrought in fear

    And the devil of Martin Luther sat

    By the stout monks side in social chat

    The Old Man of the Sea on the neck of
    him
    Who seven times crossed the deep
    Twined closely each lean and withered
    limb
    Like the nightmare in ones sleep
    But he cbank of the wine and Sindbad

    east
    The evil weight from his back at last

    But the demon that cometh day by day
    To my quiet room and fireside nook

    Where the casement light falls dim and
    gray
    On faded painting and ancient book

    Is a sorrier one than any whose names

    Are chronicled well by good King James

    No bearer of burdens like Caliban
    No runner of errands like Ariel

    He comes in the shape of a fat old man
    Without rap of knuckle or pull of bell

    And whence he comes or whither he goes

    I know as I do of the wind which blows

    A stout old man with a greasy hat

    Slouched heavily down to his dark red
    nose

    And two gray eyes enveloped in fat

    Looking through glasses with iron bows

    Read ye and heed ye and ye who can

    Guard well your doors from that old man

    He comes witli a careless  How d ye do
    And seats himself in my elbowchair

    And my morning paper and pamphlet new
    Fall forthwitli muler his special care



    And he wipes his glasses and clears his

    throat
    And button by button unfolds his coat

    And then he reads from paper and book
    In a low and husky asthmatic tone

    With the stolid sameness of posture and
    look
    Of one who reads to himself alone

    And hour after hour on my senses come

    That husky wheeze and that dolorous hum

    The price of stocks the auction sales
    The poets song and the lovers glee

    The horrible murders the seaboard gales
    The marriage list and the jm d esprit

    All reach my ear in the selfsame tone

    I shudder at each but the fiend reads on

    Oh sweet as the lapse of water at noon

    Oer the mossy roots of some forest tree
    The sigh of the Avind in the woods of Jmie

    Or somid of flutes oer a moonlight sea
    Or the low soft music perchance which

    seems
    To float through the slumbering singers
    dreams

    So sweet so dear is the silvery tone

    Of her in whose features I sometimes look

    As I sit at eve by her side alone

    And we read by turns from the selfsame
    book

    Some tale perhaps of the olden time

    Some lovers romance or quamt old rhyme

    Then when the story is one of woe
    Some prisoners plaint through his dun
    geonbar

    Her blue eye glistens with tears and low
    Her voice sinks down like a moan afar

    And I seem to hear that prisoners wail

    And his face looks on me worn and pale

    And when she reads some merrier song
    Her voice is glad as an April birds

    And when the tale is of war and wrong
    A trmnpets summons is in her words

    And the rush of the hosts I seem to hear

    And see the tossing of plume and spear

    Oh pity me then when day by day

    The stout fiend darkens my parlor door

    And reads me perchance the selfsame lay
    Which melted hi music the night before



    THE FOUNTAIN



    From lips as the lips of Hylas sweet
    And moved like twin roses which zephyrs
    meet

    I cross my floor with a nervous tread
    I whistle and laugh and sing and shout

    I flourish my cane above his head
    And stir up the fire to roast him out

    I topple the chairs and drum on the pane

    And press my hands on my ears in vain

    I ve studied Glanalle and James the wise
    And wizard blackletter tomes which treat

    Of demons of every name and size

    Which a Christian man is presumed to
    meet

    But never a hint and never a line

    Can I find of a reading fiend like mine

    Ive crossed the Psalter with Brady and
    Tate

    And laid the Primer above them all
    I ve nailed a horseshoe over the grate

    And hung a wig to my parlor wall
    Once worn by a learned Judge they say
    At Salem coiut in the witchcraft day

    Conjuro te sceleratissime

    Ahire ad tuum locum    still

    Like a visible nightmare he sits by me
    The exorcism has lost its skill

    And I hear agam in ray haunted room

    The husky wheeze and the dolorous hum

    Ah  commend me to Mary Magdalen
    With her sevenfold plagues to the
    wandering Jew

    To the terrors which haunted Orestes when
    The furies his midnight curtains drew

    But charm liim off ye who charm him can

    That reading demon that fat old man



    THE FOUNTAIN

    On the declivity of a hill in Salisbury Essex
    County is a fountain of clear water gushing
    from the very roots of a venerable oak It is
    about two miles from the junction of the
    Powow River with the Merrimac

    Traveller  on thy journey toiling

    By the snft Powow
    With the summer sunshine falling

    On thy heated brow



    Listen while all else is still
    To the brooklet from the hUl

    Wild and sweet the flowers are blowing

    By that streamlets side
    And a greener verdure showing

    Where its waters glide
    Down the hillslope mirrmuring on
    Over root and mossy stone

    Where yon oak his broad arms flingeth

    Oer the sloping hill
    Beautiful and freshly springeth

    That softflowing rill
    Through its dark roots wreathed and bare
    Gushing up to sun and air

    Brighter waters sparkled never

    In that magic well
    Of whose gift of life forever

    Ancient legends tell
    In the lonely desert wasted
    And by mortal lip untasted

    Waters which the proud Castilian

    Sought with longing eyes
    Underneath the bright pavilion

    Of the Indian skies
    Where his forest pathway lay
    Through the blooms of Florida

    Years ago a lonely stranger

    With the dusky brow
    Of the outcast forestranger

    Crossed the smft Powow
    And betook him to the rill
    And the oak upon the hill

    Oer his face of moody sadness

    For an instant shone
    Something like a gleam of gladness

    As he stooped him down
    To the fountains grassy side
    And his eager thirst supplied

    With the oak its shadow throwing

    Oer his mossy seat
    And the cool sweet waters flowing

    Softly at his feet
    Closely by the fountains rim
    That lone Indian seated him

    Autumns earliest frost had given

    To the woods below
    Hues of beauty such as heaven

    Far behind was Ocean striving

    With his chains of sand
    Southward simny glimpses giving

    Twixt the swells of land
    Of its calm and silvery track

    From the blackened forges broke

    Could it be his fathers ever

    Loved to linger here
    These bare hills this conquered river

    Could they hold them dear
    With their native loveliness
    Tamed and tortured into this

    Sadly as the shades of even

    PENTUCKET

    The village of Haverhill on the Merrimac
    called by the Indians Peiitiicket was for
    nearly seventeen years a frontier town and
    during thirty years endured all the horrors of
    savage warfare In the year 1708 a combined
    body of French and Indians under the com
    mand of De Chaillons and Hertel de Rouville
    the infamous and bloody saeker of Deerfield
    made an attack upon the village which at that
    time contained only thirty houses Sixteen of
    the villagers were massacred and a still larger
    number made prisoners About thirty of the
    enemy also fell and among them Hertel de
    Rouville The minister of the place Benja
    min Rolfe was killed by a shot through his
    own door In a paper entitled The Border
    War of 170S published in my collection of
    Recreations and Miscellanies I have given a
    prose narrative of the siuprise of HaverhiU

    How sweetly on the woodgirt town
    The mellow light of sunset shone
    Each small bright lake whose waters still
    Mirror the forest and the hill
    Reflected from its waveless breast
    The beauty of a cloudless west
    Glorious as if a glimpse were given
    Witliin the western gates of heaven
    Left by the spirit of the star
    Of sunsets holy hour ajar

    Beside the rivers tranqiiil flood
    The dark and lowwalled dwellings stood
    Where many a rood of open land
    Stretched up and down on either hand



    THE NORSEMEN



    With cornleaves waving freslily green
    The thick and blackened stumps between
    Behind imbroken deep and dread
    The wild untravelled forest spread
    Back to those mountains white and cold
    Of which the Indian trapper told
    Upon whose summits never yet
    Was mortal foot in safety set

    Quiet and calm without a fear
    Of danger darkly lurking near
    The weary laborer left his plough
    The milkmaid carolled by her cow
    From cottage door and household hearth
    Rose songs of praise or tones of mirth
    At length the murmur died away
    And silence on that village lay
    So slept Pompeii tower and hall
    Ere the quick earthquake swallowed all
    Undreaming of the fiery fate
    Which made its dwellings desolate

    Hours passed away By moonlight sped
    The Merrimac along his bed
    Bathed in the pallid lustre stood
    Dark cottagewall and rock and wood
    Silent beneath that tranquil beam
    As the hushed grouping of a dream
    Yet on the still air crept a sound
    No bark of fox nor rabbits bound
    Nor stir of wings nor waters flowing
    Nor leaves in midnight breezes blowing

    Was that the tread of many feet
    Which downward from the hillside beat
    What forms were those which darkly stood
    Just on the margm of the wood
    Charred treestumps in the moonlight dim
    Or paling rude or leafless limb
    No  through the trees fierce eyeballs

    glowed
    Dark human forms in moonshine showed
    Wild from their native wilderness
    With painted limbs and battledress

    A yell the dead might wake to hear
    Swelled on the night air far and clear
    Then smote the Indian tomahawk
    On crashing door and shatteruig lock
    Then rang the rifleshot and then
    The shrill deathscream of stricken men
    Sank the red axe in womans brain
    And childhoods cry arose in vain
    Bursting through roof and window came
    Red fast and fierce the kindled flame



    And blended fire and moonlight glared
    On still dead men and scalpknives bared

    The morning sun looked brightly through
    The river willows wet with dew
    No somid of combat filled the air
    No shout was heard nor gmishot there
    Yet still the thick and sullen smoke
    From smoiddering ruins slowly broke
    And on the greensward many a stain
    And here and there the mangled slain
    Told how that midnight bolt had sped
    Pentucket on thy fated head

    Even now the villager can tell
    Where Rolfe beside his hearthstone fell
    Still show the door of wastmg oak
    Tlrrough which the fatal deathshot broke
    And point the curious stranger where
    De Rouvilles corse lay grim and bare
    Whose hideous head in death still feared
    Bore not a trace of hair or beard
    And still within the churchyard ground
    Heaves darkly U2 the ancient mound
    Whose grassgrovn siuface overlies
    The victims of that sacrifice



    THE NORSEMEN

    In the early part of the present century a
    fragment of a statue rudely chiselled from
    dark gray stone was found in the town of
    Bradford on the Memmac Its origin must
    be left entirely to conjectiue The fact that
    the ancient Northmen visited the northeast
    coast of North America and probably New
    England some centuries before the discovery
    of the western world by Columbus is now very
    generally admitted

    Gift from the cold and silent Past I

    A relic to the present cast

    Left on the everchanging strand

    Of shifting and unstable sand

    Which wastes beneath the steady chime

    And beating of the waves of Time

    Who from its bed of primal rock

    First nTenched thy dark unshapely block

    Whose hand of curious skill untaught

    Thy rude and savage outline wrought

    Tlie waters of my native stream
    Are glancing in the smis warm beam
    From sailiuged keel and flashing oar
    The circles widen to its shore



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And cultured field and peopled town
    Slope to its willowed margin down
    Yet while this morning breeze is bringing
    The homelife sound of schoolbells ring
    ing
    And rolling wheel and rapid jar
    Of the firewinged and steedless car
    And voices from the wayside near
    Come quick and blended on my ear
    A spell is in this old gray stone
    My thoughts are with the Past alone

    A change   The steepled town no more

    Stretches along the sailtlironged shore

    Like palacedomes in simsets cloud

    Fade sungilt spire and mansion proud

    Spectrally rising where they stood

    I see the old primeval wood

    Dark shadowlike on either hand

    I see its solemn waste expand

    It climbs the green and cultured hill

    It arches oer the valleys rill

    And leans from cliff and crag to throw

    Its wild arms oer the stream below

    Unchanged alone the same bright river

    Flows on as it will flow forever

    I listen and I hear the low

    Soft ripple where its waters go

    I hear behind the panthers cry

    The wildbiids scream goes thrilling by

    And shyly on the rivers brink

    The deer is stooping down to diink

    But hark   from wood and rock flung back
    What soimd comes up the Merrimac
    What seaworn barks are those which tlirow
    The light spray from eacli rushing prow
    Have they not in tlie North Seas blast
    Bowed to the waves the strainmg mast
    Their frozen sails the low pale sun
    Of Thules night has shone upon
    Flapped by the seawinds gusty sweep
    Round icy drift and headland steep
    WUd Jutlands wives and Loclilins daugh
    ters
    Have watched them fading oer the waters
    Lessening througli driving mist and spray
    Like whitewinged seabirds on their way

    Onward they glide  and now I view
    Their ironarmed and stalwart crew
    Joy glistens in each wild blue eye
    Turned to green earth and summer sky
    Each broad seamed breast has cast aside
    Its cumbering vest of shaggy hide



    Bared to the sun and soft warm air
    Streams back the Northmens yellow hair
    I see the gleam of axe and spear
    A somid of smitten shields I hear
    Keeping a harsh and fitting time
    To Sagas chant and Runic rhyme
    Such lays as Zetlands Scald has simg
    His gray and naked isles among
    Or muttered low at midnight hour
    Roimd Odins mossy stone of power
    Tlie wolf beneath the Arctic moon
    Has answered to that startling rmie
    The Gael has heard its stormy swell
    The light Frank knows its summons well
    lonas sablestoled Culdee
    Has heard it sounding oer the sea
    And swept with hoary beard and hair
    His altars foot in trembling prayer

    T is past  the wildering vision dies

    In darkness on my dreaming eyes

    The forest vanishes in air

    Hillslope and vale lie starkly bare

    I hear the common tread of men

    And hum of workday life again

    The mystic relic seems alone

    A broken mass of common stone

    And if it be the chiselled limb

    Of Berserker or idol grim

    A fragment of Valhallas Thor

    The stormy Vikings god of War

    Or Praga of the Runic lay

    Or loveawakening Siona

    I know not  for no graven line

    Nor Druid mark nor Rimic sign

    Is left me here by which to trace

    Its name or origin or place

    Yet for tliis vision of the Past

    This glance upon its darkness cast

    My spirit bows in gratitude

    Before the Giver of all good

    AVlio fashioned so the human mind

    That from the waste of Time behind

    A simple stone or mound of earth

    Can summon the departed forth

    Quicken the Past to life again

    The Present lose in what hath been

    And in their primal freslniess show

    The buried forms of long ago

    As if a portion of that Thought

    By which the Eternal will is wiought

    Whose impulse fills anew with breath

    The frozen solitude of Death

    To mortal mind were sometimes lent

    To mortal musings sometimes sent



    FUNERAL TREE OF THE SOKOKIS



    To whisper  even when it seems
    But Memorys fantasy of dreams
    Through the minds waste of woe and sin
    Of au immortal origrin



    FUNERAL TREE OF THE
    SOKOKIS

    Polan chief of the Sokokis Indians of the
    country between Agamenticus and Casco Bay
    was killed at Windham on Sebago Lake in the
    spring of 1756 After the whites had retired
    the surviving Indians  swayed  or bent down
    a young tree until its roots were upturned
    placed the body of their chief beneath it and
    then released the tree which in springmg
    back to its old position covered the grave
    The Sokokis were early converts to the Catho
    lic faith Most of them prior to the year 1756
    had removed to the French settlements on the
    St Francois

    Around Sebagos lonely lake
    There lingers not a breeze to break
    The mirror wliich its waters make

    The solemn pines along its shore

    The firs wliich hang its gray rocks oer

    Are painted on its glassy floor

    The Sim looks oer with hazy eye
    The snowA mountaintops which lie
    Piled colclly up against the sky

    Dazzling and white  save where the

    bleak
    Wild winds have bared some splintering

    peak
    Or snowslide left its dusky streak

    Yet green are Sacos banks below
    And belts of sjruce and cedar show
    Dark fringing roimd those cones of snow

    The earth hath felt the breath of spring
    Though yet on her deliverers wing
    The lingering frosts of winter cling

    Fresh grasses fringe the meadowbrooks
    And mildly from its sunny nooks
    Tlie blue eye of the iolet looks

    And odors from the springing grass
    The sweet birch and the sassafras
    Upon the scarcefelt breezes pass



    Her tokens of renewing care
    Hath Nature scattered everywhere
    In bud and flower and warmer air

    But in their hour of bitterness
    What reck the broken Sokokis
    Beside their slaughtered chief of this

    The turfs red stain is yet midried
    Scarce have the deathshot echoes died
    Along Sebagos wooded side

    And silent now the himters stand
    Grouped darkly where a swell of land
    Slopes upward from the lakes white sand

    Fire and the axe have swept it bare
    Save one lone beech unclosing there
    Its light leaves in the vernal air

    With grave cold looks all sternly mute
    They break the damp turf at its foot
    And bare its coiled and twisted root

    They heave the stubborn trmik aside
    The firm roots from the earth divide
    The rent beneath yawns dark and vide

    And there the fallen chief is laid
    In tasselled garb of skins arrajed
    And girded with his wampumbraid

    The silver cross he loved is pressed
    Beneath the heavy arms which rest
    Upon his scarred and naked breast

    T is done  the roots are backward sent
    The beechentree stands iip imbent
    The Indians fitting monument

    When of that sleepers broken race
    Their green and pleasant dwellingplace
    Which knew them once retains no trace

    Oh long may sunsets light be shed
    As now upon that beechs head
    A green memorial of the dead

    There shall his fitting requiem be
    In northern winds that cold and free
    Howl nightly in that funeral tree

    To their wild wail the waves which break
    Forever round that lonely lake
    A solemn midertone shall make



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And who shall deem the spot imblest
    Where Natures yoimger children rest
    Lulled on their sorrowing mothers breast

    Deem ye that mother loveth less
    These bronzed forms of the wilderness
    She foldeth in her long caress

    As sweet oer them her wildflowers blow
    As if with fairer hair and brow
    The blueeyed Saxon slept below

    What though the places of their rest
    No priestly knee hath ever pressed
    No funeral rite nor prayer hath blessed

    Vliat though the bigots ban be there
    And thoughts of wailing and despair
    And cursing in the place of prayer

    Yet Heaven hath angels watching round
    The Indians lowliest forestmomid
    And they have made it holy groimd

    There ceases mans frail judgment  all
    His powerless bolts of cursing fall
    Unheeded on that grassy pall

    O peeled and himted and reviled
    Sleep on dark tenant of the wild
    Great Natme owns her simple child

    And Natures God to whom alone
    The secret of the heart is known
    The hidden language traced thereon

    Who from its many cumberings

    Of form and creed and outward things

    To light the naked spirit brings

    Not with our partial eye shall scan
    Not with our pride and scorn shall ban
    The spirit of our brother man

    ST JOHN

    The fierce rivalry between Charles de La
    Tour a Protestant and DAulnay Charnasy a
    Catholic for the possession of Acadia forms
    one of tlie most romantic passages in the history
    of the New World La Tour received aid in sev
    eral instances from the Puritan colony of Mas
    sachusetts During one of his voyages for the
    purpose of obtaining arms and provisions for
    his establishment at St John his castle was
    attacked by DAulnay and successfully de



    fended by its highspirited mistress A second
    attack however followed in the fourth month
    1G47 when DAuluay was successful and the
    garrison was put to the sword Lady La Tour
    languished a few days in the hands of her ene
    my and then died of grief

    To the winds give om banner

    Bear homeward again
    Cried the Lord of Acadia

    Cried Charles of Estienne
    From the prow of his shallop

    He gazed as the sim
    From its bed in the ocean

    Streamed up the St Jolm

    Oer the blue western waters

    That shallop had passed
    Where the mists of Penobscot

    Clung damp on her mast
    St Saviour had looked

    On the heretic sail
    As the songs of the Huguenot

    Rose on the gale

    The pale ghostly fathers

    Remembered her well
    And had cursed her while passing

    With taper and bell
    But the men of Monhegan

    Of Papists abhorred
    Had welcomed and feasted

    The heretic Lord

    They had loaded his shallop

    With dunfish and ball
    With stores for his larder

    And steel for his wall
    Pemaquid from her bastions

    And turrets of stone
    Had welcomed his coming

    With banner and gun

    And the prayers of the elders

    Had followed liis way
    As homeward he glided

    Down Pentecost Bay
    Oh well sped La Tour

    For in peril and pain
    His lady kept watch

    For his coming again

    Oer the Isle of the Pheasant

    The morning sun shone
    On the planetrees which shaded

    The shores of St John



    ST JOHN



    13



    Now why from yon battlenieuts
    Speaks not my love
    Why waves there no banner
    My fortress above

    Dark and wild from his deck

    St Estienue gazed about
    On firewasted dwellings

    And silent redoubt
    From the low shattered wails

    Which the flame had oerrua
    There floated no banner

    There thundered no gun

    But beneath the low arch

    Of its doorway there stood
    A pale priest of Rome

    In his cloak and his hood
    With the bound of a lion

    La Tour sprang to land
    On the throat of the Papist

    He fastened his hand

    Speak son of the Woman

    Of scarlet and sin
    What wolf has been prowling

    My castle within
    From the grasp of the soldier

    The Jesuit broke
    Half in scorn half in sorrow

    He smiled as he spoke

    No wolf Lord of Estieune

    Has ravaged thy hall
    But thy redhanded rival

    Witii fire steel and ball
    On an errand of mercy

    I hitherward came
    While the walls of thy castle

    Yet spouted with flame

    Pentagoets dark vessels

    Were moored in the bay
    Grim sealions roaring

    Aloud for their prey
    But what of my lady

    Cried Charles of Estienue
    On the shotcrumbled turret

    Thy lady was seen

    Halfveiled in the smokecloud
    Her hand grasped thy pennon
    While her dark tresses swayed
    In the hot breath of cannon



    But woe to the heretic

    Evermore woe
    When the son of the church

    And the cross is his foe

    In the track of the shell

    In the path of the ball
    Pentagoet swept over

    The breach of the wall
    Steel to steel gim to gun

    One moment  and then
    Alone stood the victor

    Alone with his men

    Of its sturdy defenders

    Thy lady alone
    Saw the crossblazoned banner

    Float over St John
    Let the dastard look to it

    Cried fiery Estienue
    Were DAulnay King Louis

    I d free her again

    Alas for thy lady

    No service from thee
    Is needed by her

    Whom the Lord hath set free
    Nine days in stern silence

    Her thraldom she bore
    But the tenth morning came

    And Death opened her door

    As if suddenly smitten

    La Tour staggered back
    His hand grasped his swordhilt

    His forehead grew black
    He sprang on the deck

    Of his shallop agam
    We cruise now for vengeance

    Give way   cried Estienue

    Massachusetts shall hear

    Of the Huguenots wrong
    And from island and creekside

    Her fishers shall throng
    Pentagoet shall rue

    What his Papists have done
    When his palisades echo

    The Puritans guu

    Oh the loveliest of heavens
    Hung tenderly oer him

    There were waves in the sunshine
    And green isles before him

    THE CYPRESSTREE OF CEYLON

    Ibn Batuta the celebrated Mussulman trav
    eller of the fourteenth century speaks of a
    cypresstree ui Ceylon universally held sacred
    by the natives the leaves of which were said
    to fall oidy at certain intervals and he who
    had the happiness to find and eat one of them
    was restored at once to youth and vigor The
    traveller saw several venerable Jogees or saints
    sitting silent and motionless under the tree

    They sat in silent watchfulness
    The sacred cypresstree about

    And from beneath old wrinkled brows
    Their failing eyes looked out

    Gray Age and Sickness waiting there
    Through weary night and lingering
    day

    Grim as the idols at their side
    And motionless as they

    Unheeded in the boughs above

    The song of Ceylons birds was sweet

    Unseen of them the island flowers
    Bloomed brightly at their feet

    Oer them the tropic nightstorm swept
    The thimder crashed on rock and hill

    The cloudfire on their eyeballs blazed
    Yet there they waited still

    What was the world without to them

    The Moslems smisetcall the dance
    Of Ceylons maids the passing gleam

    Of battleflag and lance

    They waited for that falling leaf

    Of which the wandering Jogees sing

    Which lends once more to wintry age
    The greenness of its spring

    Oh if these poor and blinded ones
    In trustful patience wait to feel

    Oer torpid pulse and failing limb
    A youthful freshness steal

    Shall we who sit beneath that Tree
    Whose healing leaves of life are shed



    In answer to the breath of prayer
    Upon the waiting head

    Not to restore our failing forms
    And build the spirits broken shrine

    But on the fainting soul to shed
    A light and life divine

    Shall we grow weary in our watch
    And muimur at the long delay

    Impatient of our Fathers time
    And His appointed way

    Or shall the stir of outward things
    Allure and claim the Christians eye

    When on the heathen watchers ear
    Their powerless murmms die

    Alas  a deeper test of faith

    Than prison cell or martyrs stake

    The selfabasing watchfulness
    Of silent prayer may make

    We gird us bravely to rebuke

    Our erring brother in the wrong

    And in the ear of Pride and Power
    Our warning voice is strong

    Easier to smite with Peters sword

    Than  watch one hour  in humbling
    prayer

    Lifes  great things like the Syrian lord
    Our hearts can do and dare

    But oh  we shrink from Jordans side
    From waters which alone can save

    And miumur for Abanas banks
    And Pharpars brighter wave

    O Thou who in the gardens shade
    Didst wake Thy weary ones again

    Wlio slumbered at that fearful hour
    Forgetful of Thy pain

    Bend oer us now as over them

    And set our sleepbomid spirits free

    Nor leave us slumbering in the watch
    Our soids should keep with Thee



    THE EXILES

    The incidents upon which the following bal
    lad has its foundation occurred about the year
    1G60 Thomas Macy was one of the first if



    THE EXILES



    15



    not the first white settler of Nantucket The
    career of Macy is briefly but carefully outlined
    in James S Pikes The New Puritan

    The goodmau sat beside his door

    One sultry afternoon
    With his young wife singing at his side

    An old and goodly tune

    A glimmer of heat was in the air
    The dark green woods were stiU

    And the skirts of a heavy thundercloud
    Hung over the western hill

    Black thick and vast arose that cloud

    Above the wilderness
    As some dark world from upper air

    Were stooping over this

    At times the solemn thimder pealed

    And all was still again
    Save a low murmur in the air

    Of coming wind and rain

    Just as the first big raindrop fell

    A weary stranger came
    And stood before the farmers door

    With travel soiled and lame

    Sad seemed he yet sustaining hope

    Was in his quiet glance
    And peace like autumns moonlight
    clothed

    His tranquU comitenance

    A look like that his Master wore

    In Pilates councilhall
    It told of wrongs but of a love

    Meekly forgiving all

    Friend  wilt thou give me shelter
    here

    The stranger meekly said
    And leaning on liis oaken stafF

    The goodmans features read

    My life is hunted  evil men

    Are following in my track
    The traces of the torturers whip

    Are on my aged back

    And much I fear t will peril thee

    Within thy doors to take
    A hunted seeker of the Truth

    Oppressed for conscience sake



    Oh kindly spoke the goodmans wife
    Come in old man   quoth she

    We will not leave thee to the storm
    Whoever thou mayst be

    Then came the aged wanderer in

    And silent sat him down
    WhUe all within grew dark as night

    Beneath the stormclouds frown

    But while the sudden lightnings blaze

    Filled every cottage nook
    And with the jarring thunderroll

    The loosened casements shook

    A heavy tramp of horses feet

    Came sounding up the lane
    And half a score of horse or more

    Came plunging through the rain

    Now Goodman Macy ope thy door
    We would not be housebreakers

    A rueful deed thou st done this day
    In harboring banished Quakers

    Out looked the cautious goodman then

    With much of fear and awe
    For there with broad wig dienched with
    rain

    The parish priest he saw

    Open thy door thou wicked man

    And let thy pastor in
    And give God thanks if forty stripes

    Repay thy deadly sin

    What seek ye   quoth the goodman

    The stranger is my guest
    He is worn with toil and grievous vlong

    Pray let the old man rest

    Now out upon thee canting knave
    And strong hands shook the door

    Believe me Macy quoth the priest
    Thou It rue thy conduct sore

    Then kindled Macys eye of fire
    No priest who walks the earth

    Shall pluck away the strangerguest
    Made welcome to my hearth

    Down from his cottage wall he caught

    The matchlock hotly tried
    At Prestonpans and Marstonmoor

    Where Puritan and Cavalier

    With shout aud psalm coutended

    And Ruperts oath aud Cromwells prayer
    With battlethuuder blended

    Up rose the aucieut stranger then

    My spuit is not free
    To bring the wrath aud violence

    Of evil men on thee

    And for thyself I pray forbear

    Bethink thee of thy Lord
    Who healed again the smitten ear

    And sheathed His followers sword

    I go as to the slaughter led

    Friends of the poor farewell
    Beneath his hand the oaken door

    Back on its hinges fell

    Come forth old graybeard yea and nay

    The reckless scoffers cried
    As to a horsemans saddlebow

    The old mans arms were tied

    And of his bondage hard and long

    Li Bostons crowded jail
    Where suffering womans prayer was
    heard

    With sickening childhoods wail

    It suits not with our tale to tell

    Those scenes have passed away
    Let the dim shadows of the past

    Brood oer that evil day

    Ho sheriff   quoth the ardent priest

    Take Goodman Macy too
    The sin of tliis days heresy

    His back or pmse shall rue

    Now goodwife haste thee   Macy cried

    She caught liis manly arm
    Behind the parson urged pursuit

    With outcry and alarm

    Ho  speed the Macys neck or naught

    The rivercourse was near
    The plashing on its pebbled shore

    Was music to their ear

    A gray rock tasselled oer with birch

    Above the waters hung
    And at its base with every wave

    A small light wherry swmig



    A leap  they gain the boat  and there
    The goodmau wields his oar

    111 luck betide them all he cried
    The laggards on the shore

    Down through the crashing miderwood

    The bmly sheiiff came
    Stand Goodman Macy yield thyself

    Yield in the Kings own name

    Now out upon thy hangmans face
    Bold Macy answered then

    Whip women on the village green
    But meddle not with men

    The priest came panting to the shore
    His grave cocked hat was gone

    Behind him like some owls nest hung
    His wig ujjon a thorn

    Come back  come back   the parson criec
    The churchs cmse beware

    Curse an thou wilt said Macy but
    Thy blessing prithee spare

    Vile scoffer   cried the baffled priest
    Thou It yet the gallows see

    Whos born to be hanged will not b
    drowned
    Quoth Macy merrily

    And so sir sheriff and priest goodby

    He bent him to his oar
    And the small boat glided quietly

    From the twain upon the shore

    Now in the west the heavy clouds

    Scattered and fell asunder
    While feebler came the rusli of rain

    And fainter growled the thunder

    And through the broken clouds the sun

    Looked out serene and warm
    Painting its holy symbollight

    Upon the passing storm

    Oh beautiful  that rainbow span
    Oer dim Craneneck was bended

    One bright foot touched the eastern hills
    And one with ocean blended

    By green Pentuckets southern slope

    The small boat glided fast

    That night a stalwart garrison


    How others drew around them


    Sat shaking in their shoes


    And liow their fishing sped


    To hear the dip of Indian oars


    Until to every wind of heaven


    The glide of birch canoes


    Nantuckets sails were spread


    The fisherwives of Salisbury


    How pale Want alternated


    The men were all away


    With Plentys golden smile


    Looked out to see the stranger oar


    Behold is it not written


    Upon their waters play


    In the annals of the isle


    Deer Islands rocks and firtrees threw


    And yet that isle remaiueth


    Their sunsetshadows oer them


    A refuge of the free


    And Newburys spire and weathercock


    As when truehearted Macy


    Peered oer the pines before them


    Beheld it from the sea


    Around the Black Rocks on their left


    Free as the winds that winuow


    The marsh lay broad and green


    Her shrubless hills of sand


    And on their right with dwarf shrubs


    Free as the waves that batter


    crowned


    Along her yielding land


    Plum Islands hills were seen






    Than hers at dutys summons


    With skilful hand and wary eye


    No loftier spiiit stirs


    The harborbar was crossed


    Nor falls oer human suffering


    A plaything of the restless wave


    A readier tear than hers


    The boat on ocean tossed






    God bless the seabeat island


    The glory of the sunset heaven


    And grant forevermore


    On land and water lay


    That charity and freedom dwell


    On the steep hills of Agawam


    As now upon her shore

    Shone like a setting star


    The sun shall sink again




    Farewell to life and all its ills


    How brightly broke the morning


    Farewell to cell and chain


    On Massachusetts Bay




    Blue wave and bright green island


    Tliese prison shades are dark and cold


    Rejoicing in the day


    But darker far than they




    The shadow of a sorrow old


    On passed the bark in safety


    Is on my heart alway


    Round isle and headland steep




    No tempest broke above tliem


    For since the day when Warkworth wood


    No fogcloud veiled the deep


    Closed oer my steed and I




    An alien from my name and blood


    Far round the bleak and stormy Cape


    A weed cast out to die


    The venturous Macy passed




    And on Nantuckets naked isle


    When looking back in sunset light


    Drew up his boat at last


    I saw her turret gleam




    And from its casement far and white


    And how in logbuilt cabin


    Her sign of farewell stream


    They braved the rough seaweather




    And there in peace and quietness


    Like one who from some desert shore


    Went down lifes vale together


    Doth homes green isles descry



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And vainly longing gazes oer
    The waste of wave and sky

    So from the desert of my fate

    I gaze across the past
    Forever on lifes dialplate

    The shade is backward cast

    I ve wandered wide from shore to shore
    I ve knelt at many a shrine

    And bowed me to the rocky floor
    Where Bethlehems tapers shine

    And by the Holy Sepulchre

    I ve pledged my knightly sword

    To Christ His blessed Church and her
    The Mother of our Lord

    Oh vain the vow and vam the strife

    How vain do all things seem
    My soul is in the past and life

    Today is but a dream

    In vain the penance strange and Ion

    And hard for flesh to bear
    The prayer the fasting and the thong

    And sackcloth shirt of hair

    The eyes of memory will not sleep

    Its ears are open still
    And vigils with the past they keep

    Against my feeble will

    And still the loves and joys of old

    Do evermore uprise
    I see the flow of locks of gold

    The shine of loving eyes

    Ah me  upon anothers breast

    Those golden locks recline
    I see upon another rest

    The glance that once was mine

    O faithless priest  O perjured knight

    I hear the Master cry
    Shut out the vision from thy sight

    Let Earth and Nature die

    The Church of God is now thy spouse
    And thou the bridegroom art

    Then let the burden of thy vows
    Crush down thy human heart

    In vain  This heart its grief must know
    Till life Itself hath ceased



    And falls beneath the selfsame blow
    The lover and the priest

    O pitying Mother  souls of light

    And saints and martyrs old
    Pray for a weak and sinful knight

    A suffering man uphold

    Then let the Paynim work his will

    And death unbind my chain
    Ere down yon blue Carpathian hill

    The sun shall fall again

    CASSANDRA SOUTHWICK

    In 1658 two yoimg persons son and daughter
    of Lawrence Southwick of Salem who had
    himself been imprisoned and deprived of nearly
    all his property for having entertained Quakers
    at Ills house were fined for nonattendance at
    church They being imable to pay the fine the
    General Court issued an order empowering
    the Treasurer of the Coimty to sell the said
    persons to any of the English nation of Virginia
    or Barbadoes to answer said fines An at
    tempt was made to carry this order into execu
    tion but no shipmaster was found willing to
    convey them to the West Indies

    To the God of all sure mercies let my bless
    ing rise today

    From the scoffer and the cruel He hath
    plucked the spoil away

    Yea He who cooled the furnace around the
    faithful three

    And tamed the Chaldean lions hath set
    His handmaid free

    Last night I saw the sunset melt through
    my prison bars

    Last night across my damp earthfloor fell
    the pale gleam of stars

    In the coldness and the darkness all through
    the long nighttime

    My grated casement whitened with au
    tumns early rime

    Alone in that dark sorrow hour after hour

    crept by
    Star after star looked palely in and sank

    adown tlie sky
    No sound amid nights stillness save that

    wliicli seemed to be
    The dull and heavy beating of the pulses

    of the sea

    All night I sat unsleeping for I knew that
    on the morrow

    The ruler and the cruel priest would mock
    me in my sorrow

    Dragged to their place of market and bar
    gained for and sold

    Like a lamb before the shambles like a
    heifer from the fold

    Oh the weakness of the flesh was there

    the shiiuking and the shame
    And the low voice of the Tempter like

    whispers to me came
    Why sitst thou thus forlornly the

    wicked murmur said
    Damp walls thy bower of beauty cold

    earth thy maiden bed

    Where be the smiling faces and voices

    soft and sweet
    Seen in thy fathers dwelling heard in the

    pleasant street
    Where be the youths whose glances the

    summer Sabbath through
    Turned tenderly and timidly unto thy

    fathers pew

    Why sitst thou here Cassandra   Be
    think thee with what mirth

    Thy happy schoolmates gather around the
    warm bright hearth

    How the crimson shadows tremble on fore
    heads white and fair

    On eyes of merry girlhood half hid in
    golden hair

    Not for thee the hearthfire brightens
    not for thee kind words are spoken

    Not for thee the nuts of Wenham woods
    by laughing boys are broken

    No firstfruits of the orchard within thy
    lap are laid

    For thee no flowers of autumn the youth
    ful hunters braid

    O weak deluded maiden   by crazy
    fancies led

    With wild and raving railers an evil path
    to tread

    To leave a wholesome worship and teach
    ing pure and sound

    And mate with maniac women loose
    haired and sackcloth bound

    Mad scoffers of the priesthood who mock
    at things divine



    Who rail against the pulpit and holy
    bread and wine

    Sore from their carttail scourgings and
    from the pillory lame

    Rejoicing in their wretchedness and glory
    ing in their shame

    And what a fate awaits thee   a sadly

    toiling slave
    Dragging the slowly lengthening chain of

    bondage to the grave
    Think of thy womans nature subdued in

    hopeless thrall
    The easy prey of any the scoff and scorn

    of all

    Oh ever as the Tempter spoke and feeble

    Natures fears
    Wrung drop by drop the scalding flow of

    unavailing tears
    I wrestled down the evil thoughts and

    strove in silent prayer
    To feel O Helper of the weak  that Thou

    indeed wert there

    I thought of Paid and Silas within Phi

    lippis cell
    And how from Peters sleeping limbs the

    prison shackles fell
    Till I seemed to har the trailing of an

    angels robe of white
    And to feel a blessed presence invisible to

    sight

    Bless the Lord for all his mercies   for

    the peace and love I felt
    Like dew of Hermons holy hill upon my

    spirit melt
    When  Get behind me Satan   was the

    language of my heart
    And I felt the Evil Temjiter ath all his

    doubts dejjart

    Slow broke the gray cold morning  again
    the sunshine fell

    Flecked with the shade of bar and grate
    wathin my lonely cell

    The hoarfrost melted on the wall and up
    ward from the street

    Came careless laugli and idle word and
    tread of passing feet

    At length the heavy bolts fell back my

    door was open cast
    And slowly at tlie sheriffs side up the

    long street I passed



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    I heard the murmur round me and felt

    but dared not see
    How from every door and window the

    peoile gazed on me

    And doubt and fear fell on me shame

    burned upon my cheek
    Swam earth and sky around me my trem

    bUng limbs grew weak
    O Lord  support thy handmaid  and

    from her soul cast out
    The fear of man which brings a snare

    the weakness and the doubt

    Then the dreary shadows scattered like a

    cloud in mornings breeze
    And a low deep voice within me seemed

    whispering words like these
    Though thy earth be as the iron and thy

    heaven a brazen wall
    Trust still His lovingkindness whose

    power is over all

    We paused at length where at my feet

    the sunlit waters broke
    On glaring reach of shining beach and

    shingly wall of rock
    The merchantships lay idly there in hard

    clear lines on high
    Tracing with rope and slender spar their

    network on the sky

    And there were ancient citizens cloak
    wrapped and grave and cold

    And grim and stout seacaptains with
    faces bronzed and old

    And on his horse with Rawson his cruel
    clerk at hand

    Sat dark and haughty Endicott the rider
    of the land

    And poisoning with his evil words the
    rulers ready ear

    The priest leaned oer his saddle with
    laugh and scoff and jeer

    It stirred my soul and from my lips the
    seal of silence broke

    As if through womans weakness a warn
    ing spirit spoke

    I cried  The Lord rebuke thee thou

    smiter of the meek
    Thou robber of the righteous thou trampler

    of the weak
    Go light the dark cold hearthstones  go

    turn the prison lock



    Of the poor hearts thou hast hunted thou
    wolf amid the flock

    Dark lowered the brows of Endicott and

    with a deeper red
    Oer Rawsons wineempurpled cheek the

    flush of anger spread
    Good people quoth the whitelipped

    priest  heed not her words so wild
    Her Master speaks within her   the Devil

    owns his child

    But gray heads shook and young brows

    knit the while the sheriff read
    That law the wicked rulers against the poor

    have made
    Who to their house of Rimmon and idol

    priesthood bring
    No bended knee of worship nor gainful

    offering

    Then to the stout seacaptains the sheriff
    turning said

    Which of ye worthy seamen will take
    this Quaker maid

    In the Isle of fair Barbadoes or on Vir
    ginias shore

    You may hold her at a higher price than
    Indian girl or Moor

    Grim and silent stood the captains  and

    when again he cried
    Speak out my worthy seamen    no

    voice no sign replied
    But I felt a hard hand press my own and

    kind words met my ear
    God bless thee and preserve thee my

    gentle girl and dear

    A weight seemed lifted from my heart a

    pitying friend was nigh
    I felt it in his hard rough hand and saw it

    in his eye
    And when again the sheriff spoke that

    voice so kind to me
    Growled back its stormy answer like the

    roaring of the sea

    Pile my ship witli bars of silver jjack

    with coins of Spanish gold
    From keelpiece up to deck2lank the

    roomage of her hold
    By the living God who made me   I

    would sooner in your bay
    Sink ship and crew and cargo than bear

    this child away



    THE NEW WIFE AND THE OLD



    Well answered worthy captain shame on

    their cruel laws
    Ran through the crowd in murmurs loud

    the peoples just applause
    Like the herdsman of Tekoa in Israel of

    old
    Shall we see the poor and righteous again

    for silver sold

    I looked on haughty Endicott  with wea
    pon halfway drawn

    Swept round the throng his lion glare of
    bitter hate and scorn

    Fiercely he drew his bridlerein and turned
    in silence back

    And sneering priest and baffled clerk rode
    murmuring in his track

    Hard after them the sheriff looked in bit
    terness of soul

    Thrice smote his staff upon the ground
    and crushed his parchment roll

    Good friends he said  since both have
    tied the ruler and the priest

    Judge ye if from their further work I be
    not well released

    Loud was the cheer which full and clear
    swept round the silent bay

    As with kind words and kinder looks he
    bade me go my way

    For He who turns the courses of the stream
    let of the glen

    And the river of great waters had turned
    the hearts of men

    Oh at that hour the very earth seemed

    changed beneath my eye
    A holier wonder round me rose the blue

    walls of the sky
    A lovelier light on rock and hill and stream

    and woodland lay
    And softer lapsed on sunnier sands the

    waters of the bay

    Thanksgiving to the Lord of life  to Him

    all praises be
    Who from the hands of evil men hath set

    his handmaid free
    All praise to Him before whose power the

    mighty are afraid
    Who takes the crafty in the snare which

    for the poor is laid

    Sing O my soul rejoicingly on evenings
    twilight calm



    Uplift the loud thanksgiving pour forth

    the grateful psalm
    Let all dear hearts with me rejoice as did

    the saints of old
    When of the Lords good angel the rescued

    Peter told

    And weep and howl ye evil priests and

    mighty men of wrong
    The Lord shall smite the proud and lay

    His hand upon the strong
    Woe to the wicked rulers in His avenging

    hour
    Woe to the wolves who seek the flocks to

    raven and devour

    But let the humble ones arise the poor in

    heart be glad
    And let the mourning ones again with

    robes of praise be clad
    For He who cooled the furnace and

    smoothed the stormy wave
    And tamed the Clialdean lions is mighty

    still to save



    THE NEW WIFE AND THE OLD

    The followiug ballad is founded upon one of
    the marvellous legends connected with the fa
    mous General M  of Hampton New Hamp
    shire who was regarded by his neighbors as a
    Yankee Faust in league with the adversary
    I give the story as I heard it when a chUd
    from a venerable family visitant

    Dark the halls and cold the feast
    Gone the bridemaids gone the jiriest
    All is over all is done
    Twain of yesterday are one
    Blooming girl and manhood gray
    Autmim in the arms of May

    Hushed within and hushed without
    Dancing feet and wrestlers shout
    Dies the bonfire on tlie hill
    All is dark and all is still
    Save the starlight save the breeze
    Moaning through the graveyard trees
    And the great seawaves below
    Pulse of the midnight beating slow

    From the brief dream of a bride
    She hath wakened at his side
    With halfuttered shriek and start
    Feels she not his beating heart



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And the pressure of his arm

    And his breathing near and warm

    Lightly from the bridal bed
    Springs that fair dishevelled head
    And a feeling new intense
    Half of shame half innocence
    Maiden fear and wonder speaks
    Through her lips and changing cheeks

    From the oaken mantel glowing
    Faintest light the lamp is throwing
    On the mirrors antique mould
    Highbacked chair and wainscot old
    And through faded curtains stealing
    His dark sleeping face revealmg

    Listless lies the strong man there
    Silverstreaked his careless hair
    Lips of love have left no trace
    On that hard and haughty face
    And that foreheads knitted thought
    Loves soft hand hath not unwroiight

    Yet she sighs  he loves me well
    More than these calm lips will tell
    Stooping to my lowly state
    He hath made me rich and great
    And I bless him though he be
    Hard and stern to all save me

    While she speaketh falls the light
    Oer her fingers small and white
    Gold and gem and costly ring
    Back the timid lustre fling
    Loves selectest gifts and rare
    His proud hand had fastened there

    Gratefully she marks the glow
    From those tapering lines of snow
    Fondly oer the sleeper bending
    His black hair with golden blending
    In her soft and light caress
    Cheek and lip together press

    Ha   that start of horror  why
    That wild stare and wilder cry
    Fidl of terror full of pain
    Is there madness in her brain
    Hark  that gasping hoarse and low
    Spare me  spare me  let me go

    God have mercy   icy cold
    Spectral hands her own enfold
    Drawing silently from them



    Loves fair gifts of gold and gem
    Waken  save me   still as death
    At her side he slumbereth

    Ring and bracelet all are gone
    And that icecold hand withdrawn
    But she hears a naiumur low
    Full of sweetness fidl of woe
    Half a sigh and half a moan
    Fear not  give the dead her own

    Ah   the dead wifes voice she knows

    That cold hand whose pressme froze

    Once in warmest life had borne

    Gem and band her own hath worn

    Wake thee  wake thee   Lo his eyes

    Open with a didl smprise

    In his arms the strong man folds her
    Closer to his breast he holds her
    Trembling limbs liis own are meeting
    And he feels her hearts quick beating
    Nay my dearest why this fear
    Hush   she saith  the dead is here

    Nay a dream  an idle dream
    But before the lamps pale gleam
    Tremblingly her hand she raises
    There no more the diainond blazes
    Clasp of pearl or ring of gold
    Ah   she sighs  her hand was cold

    Broken words of cheer he saith

    But his dark lip quivereth

    And as oer the past he thinketh

    From his young wifes arms he shrinketh

    Can those soft arms round him lie

    Underneath liis dead Avifes eye

    She her fair young head can rest

    Soothed and childlike on his breast

    And in trustful innocence

    Draw new strength and courage thence

    He the proud man feels within

    But the cowardice of sin

    She can murmur in lier thought
    Simple prayers her mother taught
    And His blessed angels call
    Whose great love is over all
    He alone in prayerless pride
    Meets the dark Past at her side

    One who living shrank with dread
    From his look or word or tread

    Unto whom her early grave
    Was as freedom to the slave
    Moves him at this midnight hour
    With the deads unconscious power

    Ah the dead the unforgot

    From their solemn homes of thought

    Where the cypress shadows blend

    Darkly over foe and friend

    Or in love or sad rebuke

    Back upon the living look

    And the tenderest ones and weakest
    Wlio their wrongs have borne the meekest
    Lifting from those dark still places
    Sweet and sadremembered faces

    THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK

    Winnepurkit otherwise called George Sa
    chem of Saiigus married a daughter of Passa
    conaway the great Pennaeook chieftain in
    1662 The wedding took place at Pennaeook
    now Concord N H and the ceremonies closed
    with a great feast According to the usages of
    the chiefs Passaconaway ordered a select num
    ber of his men to accompany the newly mar
    ried couple to the dwelling of the husband
    Avhere in turn there was another great feast
    Some time after the wife of Winnepurkit ex
    pressing a desire to visit her fathers house
    was permitted to go accompanied by a brave
    escort of her husbands chief men But when
    she wished to return her fatlier sent a mes
    senger to Saugus mforming her husband and
    asking him to come and take her away He
    returned for answer that he had escorted his
    wife to her fathers house in a style that be
    came a chief and that now if she wished to
    return her father must send her back in the
    same way This Passaconaway refused to do
    and it is said that here terminated the connec
    tion of his daughter with the Saugus chief
    Vide Mortons New Canaan

    We had been wandering for many days
    Thiough the rough northern country We

    had seen
    Tlie smiset with its bars of purple cloud
    Like a new heaven shine upward from the

    lake
    Of Winnepiseogee  and had felt
    The sunrise breezes midst the leafy isles
    Which stoop their summer beauty to the lips



    Of the bright waters We had checked our

    steeds
    Silent with wonder where the mountain

    wall
    Is piled to heaven  and through the narrow

    rift
    Of the vast rocks against whose rugged feet
    Beats the mad torrent with perpetual roar
    Where noonday is as twilight and the

    wmd
    Comes burdened with the everlasting moan
    Of forests and of faroff waterfalls
    We had looked upward where the summer

    sky
    Tasselled with clouds lightwoven by the

    sun
    Sprung its blue arch above the abutting

    crags
    Oerroofing the vast portal of the land
    Beyond the wall of mountains We had

    passed
    The high source of the Saco  and bewil
    dered
    In the dwarf sprucebelts of the Crystal

    Hills
    Had heard above us like a voice in the

    cloud
    The horn of Fabyan sounding  and atop
    Of old Agioochook had seen the mountains
    Piled to the northward shagged with

    wood and thick
    As meadow niolehills  the far sea of

    Casco
    A wliite gleam on the horizon of the east
    Fair lakes embosomed in the woods and

    hills
    Moosehillocks mountain range and Kear

    sarge
    Lifting his granite forehead to the sun

    And we had rested underneath the oaks
    Shadowing the bank whose grassy spires

    are shaken
    By the perpetual beating of the falls
    Of the wild Ammonoosuc We had tracked
    The winding Pemigewasset overhung
    By beechen shadows whitening down its

    rocks
    Or lazily gliding through its intervals
    From waving ryefields sending up the

    gleam
    Of sunlit waters We had seen the moon
    Risiug behind Umbagogs eastern pines
    Like a great Indian campfire  and its

    beams

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    At midnight spanning with a bridge of

    silver
    The Merrimac by Uucauoonucs falls

    There were five souls of us whom travels

    chance
    Had thrown together in these wild north

    hills
    A city lawyer for a month escaping
    From his dull office where the weary eye
    Saw only hot brick walls and close thronged

    streets
    Briefless as yet but with an eye to see
    Lifes sumiiest side and with a heart to

    take
    Its chances all as godsends  and his brother
    Pale from long pulpit studies yet retaining
    The warmth and freshness of a genial heart
    Whose mirror of the beautifid and true
    In Man and Nature was as yet vmdimmed
    By dust of theologic strife or breath
    Of sect or cobwebs of scholastic lore
    Like a clear crystal calm of water taking
    The hue and image of oerleaning flowers
    Sweet human faces white clouds of the

    noon
    Slant starlight glimpses through the dewy

    leaves
    And tenderest moonrise T was in truth

    a study
    To mark his spirit alternating between
    A decent and professional gravity
    And an irreverent mirthfulness which often
    Laughed in the face of his divinity
    Plucked off the sacred ephod quite un

    shrined
    The oracle and for the pattern priest
    Left us the man A shrewd sagacious

    merchant
    To whom the soiled sheet found in Craw
    fords inn
    Giving the latest news of city stocks
    And sales of cotton had a deeper meaning
    Than the great presence of the awful

    Glorified by the sunset  and his daugliter
    A delicate flower on whom had blown too

    long
    Those evil winds which sweeping from

    the ice
    And winnowing the fogs of Labrador
    Shed their cold blight round Massachusetts

    With the same breath which stirs Sjirings
    opening leaves

    stem
    Poisoning our seaside atmosphere

    It chanced
    That as we turned upon our homeward

    way
    A drear northeastern storm came howling

    up
    The valley of the Saco  and that girl
    Who had stood with us upon Mount Wash
    ington
    Her brown locks ruffled by the wind which

    whirled
    In gusts around its sharp cold pinnacle
    Who had joined our gay troutfishing in the

    streams
    Which lave that giants feet  whose laugh

    was heard
    Like a birds carol on the sunrise breeze
    Which swelled our sail amidst the lakes

    green islands
    Shrank from its harsh chill breath and

    visibly drooped
    Like a flower in the frost So in that

    quiet inn
    Which looks from Conway on the moun
    tains piled
    Heavily against the horizon of the north
    Like summer thunderclouds we made our

    home
    And while the mist hung over dripping

    hills
    And the cold winddriven raindrops all

    day long
    Beat their sad music upon roof and pane
    We strove to cheer our gentle invalid

    The lawyer in the jjauses sf the storm
    Went angling down the Saco and returning
    Recounted his adventures and mishaps
    Gave us the history of his scaly clients
    Mingling with ludicrous yet apt citations
    Of barbarous law Latin passages
    From Izaak Waltons Angler sweet and

    fresh
    As the flowerskirted streams of Stafford
    shire
    Where under aged trees the southwest

    wind
    Of soft June mornings fanned the thin

    Of the sage fisher And if trutli be told

    Is music its illumining sweet smiles
    He sang the songs she loved  and in his

    low
    Deep earnest voice recited many a page
    Of poetry the holiest tenderest lines
    Of the sad bard of Olney the sweet songs
    Simple and beautiful as Truth and Nature
    Of him whose whitened locks on Rydal

    Of her prerogative  the right divine
    Of youth and beauty  bade us versify
    The legend and with ready pencil sketched
    Its plan and outlines laughingly assigning
    To each his part and barring our excuses
    With absolute will So like the cavaliers
    Whose voices still are heard in the Romance
    Of silvertongued Boccaccio on the banks
    Of Arno with soft tales of love beguiling
    The ear of languid beauty plagueexiled
    From stately Florence we rehearsed our

    That our broad land  our sealike lakes

    By forests which have known no other

    change
    For ages than the budding and the fall
    Of leaves our valleys lovelier than those

    In tlie smoke his scalplocks swung
    Grimly to and fro

    Nightly down the river going
    Swifter was the hunters rowing
    When he saw that lodgelire glowing

    Oer the waters still and red
    And the squaws dark eye hurned brighter
    And she drew her blanket tighter
    As with quicker step and lighter

    From that door she fled

    For that chief had magic skill
    And a Panisees dark will
    Over powers of good and ill

    Powers which bless and powers which
    ban
    Wizard lord of Pennacook
    Chiefs upon their warpath shook
    When they met the steady look

    Of that wise dark man

    Tales of him the gray squaw told
    When tlie winter nightwind cold
    Pierced her blankets thickest fold

    And her fire burned low and small
    Till the very child abed
    Drew its bearskin over head
    Shrinking from the pale lights shed

    On the trembling wall

    All the subtle spirits hiding
    Under earth or wave abiding
    In the caverned rock or riding

    Misty clouds or morning breeze
    Every dark intelligence
    Secret soul and influence
    Of all things which outward sense

    Feels or hears or sees

    These the wizards skill confessed
    At his bidding banned or blessed
    Stormf ul woke or lulled to rest

    Wind and cloud and fire and flood
    Burned for him the drifted snow
    Bade through ice fresh lilies blow
    And the leaves of summer giow

    Over winters wood

    Not luitrue that tale of old
    Now as then the wise and bold
    All the powers of Nature hold

    With their sterner laws dispense
    And the chain of consequence

    Broken in their pathway lies
    Time and change their vassals making
    Flowers from icy pillows waking
    Tresses of the sunrise shaking

    Over midnight skies

    Still to th earnest soul the sun
    Rests on towered Gibeon
    And the moon of Ajalon

    Lights the battlegrounds of life
    To his aid the strong reverses
    Hidden powers and giant forces
    And the high stars in their courses

    III THE DAUGHTER

    The sootblack brows of men the yell
    Of women thronging round the bed
    The tinkling charm of ring and shell

    The Powah whispering oer the dead
    All these the Sachems home had known

    When on her journey long and wild
    To the dim World of Souls alone
    In her young beauty passed the mother of
    his child

    Three bowshots from the Sachems
    dwelling
    They laid her in the walnut shade
    Where a green hillock gently swelling

    Her fitting mound of burial made
    There trailed the vine in summer hours
    The treeperched squirrel drojjped his
    shell
    On velvet moss and palehued flowers
    Woven with leaf and spray the softened
    sunshine fell

    The Indians heart is hard and cold

    It closes darkly oer its care
    And formed in Natures sternest mould

    Is slow to feel and strong to bear
    The warpaint on the Sachems face

    Unwet with tears shone fierce and red
    And still in battle or in chase
    Dry leaf and snowrime crisped beneath his
    foremost tread

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Yet when her name was heard no more
    And when the robe her mother gave
    And small light moccasin she wore
    Had slowly wasted on her grave
    Unmarked of him the dark maids sped

    Their sunset dance and moonlit play
    No other shared bis lonely bed
    No other fair young head upon his bosom
    lay

    A lone stern man Yet as sometimes

    The tempestsmitten tree receives
    From one small root the sap which climbs
    Its topmost spray and crowning leavefi
    So from his child the Sachem drew
    A life of Love and Hope and felt
    His cold and rugged nature through
    The softness and the warmth of her young
    being melt

    A laugh which in the woodland rang

    Bemocking Aprils gladdest bird
    A light and graceful form which sprang
    To meet him when his step was
    heard
    Eyes by his lodgefire flashing dark

    Small fingers stringing bead and shell
    Or weaving mats of brighthued bark
    With these the householdgod had graced
    his wigwam well

    Child of the forest  strong and free

    Slightrobed vith loosely flowing hair
    She swam the lake or climbed the tree

    Or struck the flying bird in air
    Oer the heaped drifts of winters moon
    Her snowshoes tracked the hunters
    way
    And dazzling in the summer noon
    The blade of her light oar threw off its
    shower of spray

    Unknown to her the rigid rule

    The dull restraint the chiding frown
    The weary torture of the school
    The taming of wild nature down
    Her only lore the legends told

    Around the hunters fire at night
    Stars rose and set and seasons rolled
    Flowers bloomed and snowflakes fell un
    questioned in her sight

    Unknown to her the subtle skill

    With which the artisteye can trace
    In rock and tree and lake and hill



    The outlines of divinest grace
    Unknown the fine souls keen unrest

    Which sees admires yet yearns alway
    Too closely on her mothers breast
    To note her smiles of love the child of Na
    ture lay

    It is enough for such to be

    Of common natural things a part
    To feel with bird and stream and tree
    The pulses of the same great heart
    But we from Nature long exiled

    In our cold homes of Art and Thought
    Grieve like the strangertended child
    Which seeks its mothers arms and sees
    but feels them not

    The garden rose may richly bloom

    In cultured soil and genial air
    To cloud the light of Fashions room

    Or droop in Beautys midnight hair
    In lonelier grace to sun and clew

    The sweetbrier on the hillside shows
    Its single leaf and fainter hue
    Untrained and wildly free yet still a sister
    rose

    Thus oer the heart of Weetamoo

    Their mingling shades of joy and ill
    The instincts of her nature threw

    The savage was a woman still
    Midst outlines dim of maiden schemes

    Heartcolored prophecies of life
    Rose on the ground of her young dreams
    The light of a new home the lover and the
    wife



    IV THE WEDDING

    Cool and dark fell the autumn night

    But the Bashabas wigwam glowed with

    For down from its roof by green withes

    hung
    Flaring and smoking the pmeknots swung

    And along the river great woodfires
    Shot into the night their long red spires
    Showing behind the tall dark wood
    Flashing before on the sweeping flood

    In the changeful wind with shimmer and

    shade
    Now high now low that firelight played



    THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK



    29



    On treeleaves wet with evening dews
    On gliding water and still canoes

    The trapper that night on Turees brook
    And the weary fisher on Contoocook
    Saw over the marshes and through the pine
    And down on the river the dancelights
    shine

    For the Sangns Sachem had come to woo
    Tlie Bashabas daughter Weetamoo
    And laid at her fathers feet that night
    His softest furs and wampum white

    From the Crystal Hills to the far southeast
    The river Sagamores came to the feast
    And chiefs whose homes the seawinds shook
    Sat down on the mats of Pennacook

    They came from Sunapees shore of Iock
    From the snowy sources of Snooganock
    And from rough Coos whose thick woods

    shake
    Their pinecones in Umbagog Lake

    From Ammonoosucs mountain pass
    Wild as his home came Chepewass
    And the Keenomps of the hills which throw
    Their shade on the Smile of Manito

    With pipes of jieace and bows imstmng
    Glowing with paint came old and young
    In wampum and furs and feathers arrayed
    To the dance and feast the Bashaba made

    Bird of the air and beast of the field
    All which the woods and the waters yield
    On dishes of birch and hemlock piled
    Garnished and graced that banquet wild

    Steaks of the brown bear fat and large
    From the rocky slopes of the Kearsarge
    Delicate trout from Babboosuck brook
    And salmon speared in the Contoocook

    Squirrels which fed where nuts fell thick
    In the gravelly bed of the Otternic
    And small wildhens in reedsnares caught
    From the banks of Soudagardee brought

    Pike and perch from the Suncook taken
    Nuts from the trees of the Black Hills

    shaken
    Cranberries picked in the Squamscot bog
    And grapes from the vines of Piscataquog



    And drawn from that great stone vase

    which stands
    In the river scooped by a spirits hands
    Garnished with spoons of shell and horn
    Stood the birchen dishes of smoking corn

    Thus bird of the air and beast of the field
    All which the woods and the waters yield
    Furnished in that olden day
    The bridal feast of the Bashaba

    And merrily when that feast was done
    On the firelit green the dance begun
    With squaws shrill stave and deeper hum
    Of old men beating the Indian drum

    Painted and plumed with Sicalplocks fiow

    And red arms tossing and black eyes glow

    Now in the light and now in the shade
    Around the fires the dancers played

    The step was quicker the song more shrill
    And the beat of the small drums louder still
    Whenever within the circle drew
    The Saugus Sachem and Weetamoo

    The moons of forty winters had shed
    Their snow npon that chieftains head
    And toil and care and battles chance
    Had seamed his hard dark countenance

    A fawn beside the bison grim
    Why turns the brides fond eye on him
    In whose cold look is naught beside
    The triumph of a sullen jride

    Ask why the graceful grape entwines
    The rough oak with her arm of vines
    And why the gray rocks rugged cheek
    The soft lips of the mosses seek

    Why with wise instinct Nature seems
    To harmonize her wide extremes
    Linking the stronger with the weak
    Tlie haughty with the soft and meek

    shore


    That he whose name the Mohawk trembling




    beard


    No cheerful village with its mingling


    Vouchsafed to her at times a kindly look


    smokes


    or word


    No laugh of children wrestling in the




    snow


    For she had learned the maxims of her


    No campfire blazing through the hillside


    race


    oaks


    Which teach the woman to become a


    No fishers kneeling on the ice below


    slave


    Yet midst all desolate things of sound and


    And feel herself the pardonless disgrace


    view


    Of loves fond weakness in the wise and


    Through the long winter moons smiled


    brave


    darkeyed Weetamoo


    The scandal and the shame which they


    Her heart had found a liome  and freshly


    incur
    Who give to woman all which man re


    all


    quires of her


    Its beautifid affections overgrew




    Their rugoed prop As oer some granite


    So passed the winter moons The sun at


    wall


    last


    Soft vineleaves open to the moistening


    Broke link by link the frost chain of the


    dew


    rills


    And warm bright sun the love of that


    And the warm breathings of the southwest


    young wife


    passed


    Found on a hard cold breast the dew and


    Over the hoar rime of the Saugus hills


    warmth of life


    The gray and desolate marsh grew green




    once more


    The steep bleak hills the melancholy


    And the birchtrees tremulous shade fell


    shore


    round the Sachems door


    The long dead level of the marsh be




    tween


    Then from far Pennacook swift runners


    A coloring of unreal beauty wore


    came


    Through the soft golden mist of young


    With gift and greeting for the Saugus


    love seen


    chief


    For oer those hills and from that dreary


    Beseeching him in the great Sachems


    plain


    name


    Nightly she welcomed home her hunter

    THE BRIDAL OF PENNACOOK



    31



    The song of birds the warm breeze and

    the rain
    Young Weetamoo might greet lier lonely

    sire again

    And Wiunepurkit called his chiefs together
    And a grave council in his wigwam met
    Solemn and brief in words considering
    whether
    The rigid rules of forest etiquette
    Permitted Weetamoo once more to look
    Upon her fathers face and greenbanked
    Pennacook

    With interludes of pipesmoke and strong
    water
    The forest sages pondered and at length
    Concluded in a body to escort her

    Up to her fathers home of pride and
    strength
    Impressing thus on Pennacook a sense
    Of Winnepurkits power and regal conse
    quence

    So through old Avoods which Aukeetamits
    hand
    A soft and manyshaded greenness lent
    Over high breezy hills and meadow land
    Yellow with flowers the wild procession
    went
    Till rolling down its wooded banks between
    A broad clear mountain stream the Merri
    mac was seen

    The hunter leaning on his bow undrawn

    The fisher lounging on the pebbled shores
    Squaws in the clearing dropping the seed
    corn
    Young children peering through the
    wigwam doors
    Saw with delight surrounded by her train
    Of painted Saugus braves their Weetamoo
    again



    VI AT PENNACOOK

    The hills are dearest which our childish

    feet
    Have climbed the earliest  and the streams

    most sweet
    Are ever those at which our young lips

    drank
    Stooped to their waters oer the grassy

    bank



    Midst the cold dreary seawatch Homes

    hearthlight
    Shines round the helmsman plunging

    through the night
    And still with inward eye the traveller

    sees
    In close dark stranger streets his native

    trees

    The homesick dreamers brow is nightly

    fanned
    By breezes whispering of his native land
    And on the strangers dim and dying eye
    The soft sweet pictures of his cliildhood

    lie

    Joy then for Weetamoo to sit once more
    A child upon her fathers wigwam floor
    Once more with her old fondness to beguile
    From his cold eye the strange light of a
    smile

    The long bright days of summer swiftly

    passed
    The dry leaves whirled in autumns rising

    blast
    And evening cloud and whitening sunrise

    rime
    Told of the coming of the wintertime

    But vainly looked the while young Weeta
    moo

    Down the dark river for her chiefs canoe

    No dusky messenger from Saugus brought

    The grateful tidings which the young wife
    sought

    At length a runner from her father sent
    To Winnepurkits seacooled wigwam went
    Eagle of Saugus  in the woods the dove
    Mourns for the shelter of thy wings of
    love

    But the dark chief of Saugus turned aside
    In the grim anger of hardliearted pride
    I bore lier as became a chieftains

    daughter
    Up to her home beside the gliding water

    If now no more a mat for her is found
    Of all which line her fatliers wigwam

    round
    Let Pennacook call out his warrior train
    And send her back with wampum gifts

    again

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    The baffled runner turned upon his track
    Bearing the woids of Winnepurkit back
    Dog of the Marsh cried Pennacook

    no more
    Shall child of mine sit on his wigwam floor

    Go let him seek some meaner squaw to

    spread
    The stolen bearskin of his beggars bed
    Son of a fislihawk  let him dig his clams
    For some vile daughter of the Agawams

    Or coward Nipmucks  may his scalp dry

    black
    In Mohawk smoke before I send her back
    He shook his clenched hand towards the

    ocean wave
    While hoarse assent his listening council

    gave

    Alas poor bride  can thy grim sire impart
    His iron liardness to thy womans heart
    Or cold selftorturing pride like his atone
    For love denied and lifes warm beauty
    flown

    On Autumns gray and mournful grave the

    snow
    Hung its white wreaths  with stifled voice

    and low
    The river crept by one vast bridge oer

    crossed
    Built by the hoarlocked artisan of Frost

    And many a moon in beauty newly born
    Pierced the red sunset with her silver horn
    Or from the east across her azure field
    Rolled the wide brightness of her fullorbed
    shield

    Yet Winnepurkit came not  on the mat
    Of the scorned wife her dusky rival sat
    And he the while in Western woods afar
    Urged the long chase or trod the patli of



    Dry up thy tears young daughter of a

    chief
    Waste not on him the sacredness of grief
    Be the fierce spirit of thy sire thine own
    His lips of scorning and his heart of stone

    What heeds the warrior of a hundred fights
    The stormworn watcher through long hunt
    ing nights



    Cold crafty proud of womans weak dis
    tress

    Her homebound grief and pining loneli
    ness

    VII THE DEPARTURE

    The wild March rains had fallen fast and

    long
    The snowy mountains of the North among
    Making each vale a watercourse each hill
    Bright with the cascade of some newmade

    rill

    Gnawed by the sunbeams softened by the

    rain
    Heaved underneath by the swollen currents

    strain
    Tlie ice bridge yielded and the Merrimac
    Bore the huge ruin crashing down its track

    On that strong turbid water a small boat
    Guided by one weak hand was seen to float
    Evil the fate which loosed it from the shore
    Too early voyager with too frail an oar

    Down the vexed centre of that rushing tide
    The thick huge ice  blocks threatening

    either side
    The foamwhite rocks of Amoskeag in view
    With arrowy swiftness sped that light

    canoe

    The trapper moistening his mooses meat
    On the wet bank by Uncanoonucs feet
    Saw the swift boat flash down the troubled

    stream
    Slept he or waked he  was it truth or

    dream

    The straining eye bent fearfully before
    The small hand clenching on the useless oar
    The bead wrought blanket trailing oer the

    water
    He knew them all  woe for the Sachems

    daughter

    Sick and aweary of her lonely life
    Heedless of peril the still faithful wife
    Had left her mothers grave her fathers

    door
    To seek the wigwam of her chief once more

    Down the white rapids like a sear leaf
    whirled

    Empty and broken circled the canoe

    VIII SONG OF INDIAN WOMEN

    The Dark eye has left us

    The Springbird has flown
    On the pathway of spirits
    She wanders alone
    The song of the wooddove has died on our

    shore
    Mat wonck Jcunnamonee  We hear it no
    more

    O dark water Spirit

    We cast on thy wave
    These furs which may never
    Hang over her grave
    Bear down to the lost one the robes that

    she wore
    Mat wonck kunnamonee  We see her no



    Of the strange land she walks in

    No Powah has told
    It may burn with the sunshine
    Or freeze with the cold
    Let us give to our lost one the robes that

    she wore
    Iat wonck kunnamonee  We see her no
    more

    The path she is treading

    Shall soon be our own
    Each gliding in shadow
    Unseen and alone
    In vain shall we call on the souls gone be
    fore
    Mat wonck kunnamonee  They hear us
    no more

    O mighty Sowanna

    Thy gateways unfold
    From thy wigwam of sunset
    Lift curtains of gold
    Take home the poor Spirit whose journey

    is oer
    Mat wonck kunnamonee  We see her no
    more

    So sang the Ciiildren of the Leaves beside
    The broad dark rivers coldly flowing tide



    Now low now harsh with soblike pause
    and swell

    On the high wind their voices rose and
    fell

    Natures wild music  sounds of wind
    swept trees

    The scream of birds the wailing of the
    breeze

    The roar of waters steady deep and
    strong

    Mingled and murmured in that farewell

    BARCLAY OF URY

    Among the earliest converts to the doctrines
    of Friends in Scotland was Barclay of Ury an
    old and distinguished soldier who had fought
    under Gustavus Adolphus in Germany As a
    Quaker he became the object of persecution
    and abuse at the hands of the magistrates and
    tlie popidace None bore the indignities of
    the mob with greater patience and nobleness
    of soul than this once provul gentleman and
    soldier One of his friends on an occasion of
    uncommon rudeness lamented that he should
    be treated so harshly in his old age who had
    been so honored before  I find more satis
    faction said Barclay  as well as honor in
    being thus insulted for my religious principles
    than when a few years ago it was usual for
    the magistrates as I passed the city of Aber
    deen to meet me on the road and conduct me
    to public entertainment in their hall and then
    escort me out again to gain my favor

    Up the streets of Aberdeen
    By the kirk and college green

    Rode the Laird of Ury
    Close behind him close beside
    Foul of mouth and evileyed

    Pressed the mob in fury

    Flouted him the drunken churl
    Jeered at him the servinggirl

    Prompt to please her master
    And the begging carlin late
    Fed and clothed at Urys gate

    Cursed him as he passed her

    Yet with calm and stately mien
    Up the streets of Aberdeen

    Came he slowly riding
    And to all he saw and heard
    Answering not with bitter word

    Turnins not for chiding



    34



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Came a troop with broadswords swinging
    Bits and bridles sharply ringing

    Loose and free and froward
    Quoth the foremost  Ride him down
    Push him  prick him  through the town

    Drive the Quaker coward

    But from out the thickening crowd
    Cried a sudden voice and loud

    Barclay  Ho  a Barclay
    And the old man at his side
    Saw a comrade battle tried

    Scarred and sunburned darkly

    Who with ready weapon bare
    Fronting to the troopeiS there

    Cried aloud   God save us
    Call ye coward him who stood
    Ankle deep in Liitzens blood

    With the brave Gustavus

    Nay I do not need thy sword
    Comiade mine said Urys lord

    Put it up I pray thee
    Passive to His holy will
    Trust I in my Master still

    Even though He slay me

    Pledges of thy love and faith
    Proved on many a field of death

    Not by me are needed
    Marvelled much that henchman bold
    That his laird so stout of old

    Now so meekly pleaded

    Woe s the day   he sadly said
    With a slowly shaking head

    And a look of pity
    Urys honest lord reviled
    Mock of knave and sport of child

    In his own good city

    Speak the word and master mine
    As we charged on Tillys line

    And his Walloon lancers
    Smiting through their midst we 11 teach
    Civil look and decent speech

    To these boyish prancers

    Marvel not mine ancient friend
    Like beginning like the end

    Quoth the Laird of Ury
    Is the sinful servant more
    Than his gracious Lord who bore

    Bonds and stripes in Jewry



    Give me joy that in His name
    I can bear with patient frame

    All these vain ones offer
    While for them He sulfereth long
    Shall I answer wrong with wrong

    Scoffing with the scoffer

    Happier I with loss of all
    Hunted outlawed held in thrall

    With few friends to greet me
    Than when reeve and squire were seen
    Riding out from Aberdeen

    With bared heads to meet me

    When each goodwife oer and oer
    Blessed me as I passed her door

    And the snooded daughter
    Through her casement glancing down
    Smiled on him who bore renown

    From red fields of slaughter

    Hard to feel the strangers scoff
    Hard the old friends falling off

    Hard to learn forgiving
    But the Lord His own rewards
    And His love with theirs accords

    Warm and fresh and living

    Through this dark and stormy night
    Faith beholds a feeble light

    Up the blackness streaking
    Knowing Gods own time is best
    In a patient hope I rest

    For the full daybreaking

    So the Laird of Ury said
    Turning slow his horses head

    Towards the Tolbooth prison
    Where through iron gates he heard
    Poor disciples of the Word

    Preach of Christ arisen

    Not in vain Confessor old
    Unto us the tale is told

    Of thy day of trial
    Every age on him who strays
    From its broad and beaten ways

    Pours its sevenfold vial

    Happy he whose inward ear
    Angel comfortings can hear

    Oer the rabbles laughter
    And while Hatreds fagots burn
    Glimpses through the smoke discern

    Of the good hereafter

    Knowing this that never yet
    Share of Truth was vainly set

    In the worlds wide fallow
    After hands shall sow the seed
    After hands from hill and mead

    Reap the haxvests yellow

    Thus with somewhat of the Seer

    From the Future borrow
    Clothe the waste with dreams of grain

    THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA

    A letter  wiiter from Mexico durmg the
    Mexican war when detailing some of the inci
    dents at the terrible fight of Buena Vista
    mentioned that Mexican women were seen
    hoveriug near the field of death for the pur
    pose of giving aid and succor to the wounded
    One poor woman was found surrounded by the
    maimed and suffering of both armies mmister
    ing to the wants of Americans as well as Mex
    icans with impartial tenderness

    Speak and tell us our Ximena looking
    northward far away

    Oer the camp of the invaders oer the Mex
    ican array

    Who is losing  who is winning  are they
    far or come they near

    Look abroad and tell us sister whither
    rolls the storm we hear

    Down the hills of Angostura still the storm

    of battle rolls
    Blood is flowing men are dying  God have

    mercy on their souls
    Who is losing  wlio is winning   Over

    hill and over plain
    I see but smoke of cannon clouding through

    the mountain rain

    Ploly Mother  keep our brothers  Look
    Ximena look once more

    Still I see the fearful whirlwind rolling
    darkly as before

    Bearing on in strange confusion friend and
    foeman foot and horse

    Like some wild and troubled torrent sweep
    ing down its mountain course



    Look forth once more Ximena
    smoke has rolled away



    Ah  the



    And I see the Xorthern rifles gleaming down

    the ranks of gray
    Hark  that sudden blast of bugles  there

    the troop of Minon wheels
    There the Northern horses thunder with

    the cannon at their heels

    Jesu pity  how it thickens  now retreat

    and now advance
    Right against the blazing cannon shivers

    Peublas charging lance
    Down they go the brave young riders

    horse and foot together fall
    Like a ploughshare in the fallow through

    them ploughs the Northern ball

    Nearer came the stoim and nearer rolling

    fast and frightful on
    Speak Ximena speak and tell us who has

    lost and who has won
    Alas  alas  I know not  friend and foe

    together fall
    Oer the dying rush the living  pray my

    sisters for them all

    Lo  the wind the smoke is lifting

    Blessed Mother save my brain
    I can see the wounded crawling slowly out

    from heaps of slain
    Now they stagger blind and bleeding  now

    they fall and strive to rise
    Hasten sisters haste and save them lest

    they die before our eyes

    O my hearts love  O my dear one  lay

    thy poor head on my knee
    Dost thou know the lips that kiss thee

    Canst thou hear me  canst thou

    Torn with shot and pierced with lances
    bleeding slow his life away

    But as tenderly before him the lorn Ximena
    knelt

    She saw the Northern eagle shining on his
    pistolbelt

    With a stifled cry of horror straight she

    turned away her head
    With a sad and bitter feeling looked she

    back upon her dead
    But she heard the youths low moaning and

    his struggling breath of pain
    And she raised the cooling water to his

    parching lips again

    Whispered low the dying soldier pressed

    her hand and faintly smiled
    Was that pitying face his mothers  did

    she watch beside her child
    All his stranger words with meaning her

    Ah  they plead in vain for mercy  in the

    Hide your faces holy angels  O thou

    Sink O Night among thy mountains  let
    the cool gray shadows fall

    Dying brothers fighting demons drop thy
    curtain over all

    Through the thickening winter twilight
    wide apart the battle rolled

    In its sheath the sabre rested and the can
    nons lips grew cold

    But the noble Mexic women still their holy

    task pursued
    Through that long dark night of sorrow

    worn and faint and lacking food



    Over weak and suffering brothers with a

    tender care they hung
    And the dying foeman blessed them in a

    strange and Northern tongue

    Not wholly lost O Father  is this evil

    world of ours
    Upward through its blood and ashes spring

    afresh the Eden flowers
    From its smoking hell of battle Love and

    Pity send their prayer
    And still thy white winged angels hover

    dimly in our air



    THE LEGEND OF ST MARK

    This legend to which my attention was
    called by my friend Charles Sumner is the
    subject of a celebrated picture by Tintoretto
    of which Mr Rogers possesses the original
    sketch The slave lies on the ground amid a
    crowd of s2ectators who look on animated by
    all the various emotions of sympathy rage
    terror  a woman in front with a child in her
    arms has always been admired for the lifelike
    vivacity of her attitude and expression The
    executioner holds up the broken implements
    St Mark with a headlong movement seems to
    rush down from heaven in haste to save his
    worshipper The dramatic grouping in this
    picture is wonderful  the coloring in its gor
    geous depth and harmony is in Mr Rogerss
    sketch finer than in the picture  Mrs
    Jamesons Sacred and Legendary Art i 154

    The day is closing dark and cold

    With roaring blast and sleety showers

    And through the dusk the lilacs wear
    The bloom of snow instead of flowers

    I turn me from the gloom without

    To ponder oer a tale of old
    A legend of the age of Faith

    By dreaming monk or abbess told

    On Tintorettos canvas lives

    That fancy of a loving heart
    In graceful lines and shajies of power

    And hues immortal as his art

    In Provence so the story runs

    There lived a lord to whom as slave

    A peasantboy of tender years

    The chance of trade or conquest gave

    Forthlooking from the castle tower
    Beyond the hills with almonds dark



    KATHLEEN



    37



    The straining eye eonld scarce discern
    The chapel of the good St Mark

    And there when bitter word or fare
    The service of the youth repaid

    By stealth before that holy shrine

    For grace to bear his wrong he prayed

    The steed stamped at the castle gate
    The boarhunt sounded on the hill

    Why stayed the Baron from the chase
    With looks so stern and words so ill

    Go bind yon slave  and let him learn
    By scath of fire and strain of cord

    How ill they speed who give dead saints
    The homage due their living lord

    They bound him on the fearful rack

    When through the dungeons vaulted
    dark

    He saw the light of shining robes
    And knew the face of good St Mark

    Then sank the iron rack apart

    The cords released their cruel clasp

    The pincers with their teeth of fiie
    Fell broken from the torturers grasp

    And lo  before the Youth and Saint

    Barred door and wall of stone gave
    way

    And np from bondage and the night
    They passed to freedom and the day

    O dreaming monk  thy tale is true

    O painter  true thy pencils art
    In tones of hope and prophecy

    Ye whisper to my listening heart

    Unheard no burdened hearts appeal
    Moans up to Gods inclining ear

    Unheeded by his tender eye

    Falls to the earth no sufferers tear

    For still the Lord alone is God

    The pomp and power of tyrant man
    Are scattered at his lightest breath

    Like chaff before the winnowers fan

    Not always shall the slave uplift
    His heavy hands to Heaven in vain

    Gods angel like the good St Mark

    Comes shining down to break his
    chain



    O weary ones  ye may not see

    Your helpers in their downward flight

    Nor hear the sound of silver wings

    Slow beating through the hush of night

    But not the less gray Dothan shone
    Witli sunbright watchers bending low

    That Fears dim eye beheld alone
    The spearheads of the Syrian foe

    There are who like the Seer of old
    Can see the helpers God has sent

    And how lifes rugged mountainside
    Is white with many an angel tent

    They hear the heralds whom our Lord
    Sends down his pathway to prepare

    And light from others hidden shines
    On their high place of faith and prayer

    Let such for earths despairing ones
    Hopeless yet longing to be free

    Breathe once again the Prophets prayer
    Lord ope their eyes that they may
    see



    KATHLEEN

    Tliis ballad was originally published in my
    prose work Leaveifroin Margaret Smith s Jour
    nal as the song of a wandering Milesian school
    master In the seventeenth century slavery
    in the New World was by no means confined to
    the natives of Africa Political offenders and
    criminals were transported by the British gov
    ernment to the plantations of Barbadoes and
    Virginia where they were sold like cattle in the
    market Kidnapping of free and innocent
    white persons was practised to a considerable
    extent in the seaports of the United Kingdom

    O NoRAH lay your basket down

    And rest your weary hand
    And come and hear me sing a song

    Of our old Ireland

    There was a lord of Galaway

    A mighty lord was he
    And he did wed a second wife

    A maid of low degree

    But he was old and she was young

    And so in evil spite
    She baked the black bread for his kin

    And fed her own with white



    38



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    She whipped the maids and starved the
    kern

    And drove away the poor
    Ah woe is me   the old lord said

    I rue my bargain sore

    This lord he had a daughter fair

    Beloved of old and young
    And nightly round the shealingfires

    Of her the gleeman sung

    As sweet and good is young Kathleen

    As Eve before her fall
    So sang the harper at the fair

    So harped he in the hall

    Oh come to me my daughter dear I

    Come sit upon my knee
    For looking in your face Kathleen

    Your mothers own I see

    He smoothed and smoothed her hair
    away

    He kissed her forehead fair
    It is my darling Marys brow

    It is my darlings hair

    Oh then spake up the angry dame

    Get up get up quoth she
    I 11 sell ye over Ireland

    I 11 sell ye oer the sea

    She clipped her glossy hair away
    That none her rank might know

    She took away her gown of silk
    And gave her one of tow

    And sent her down to Limerick town

    And to a seaman sold
    This daughter of an Irish lord

    For ten good pounds in gold

    The lord he smote upon his breast

    And tore his beard so gray
    But he was old and she was young

    And so she had her way

    Sure that same night the Banshee howled

    To fright the evil dame
    And fairy folks who loved Kathleen

    With funeral torches came

    She watched them glancing through the
    trees
    And glimmering down the hill



    They crept before the deadvault door
    And there they all stood still

    Get up old man  the wakelights shine

    Ye murthering witch quoth he
    So I m rid of your tongue I little care

    If they shine for you or me

    Oh whoso brings my davighter back
    My gold and land shall have

    Oh then spake up his handsome page
    No gold nor land I crave

    But give to me your daughter dear

    Give sweet Kathleen to me
    Be she on sea or be she on land

    I 11 bring her back to thee

    My daughter is a lady born

    And you of low degree
    But she shall be your bride the day

    You bring her back to me

    He sailed east he sailed west

    And far and long sailed he
    Until he came to Boston town

    Across the great salt sea

    Oh have ye seen the young Kathleen

    Tlie flower of Ireland
    Ye 11 know her by her eyes so blue

    And by her snowwhite hand

    Out spake an ancient man  I know
    The maiden whom ye mean

    I bought her of a Limerick man
    And she is called Kathleen

    No skill hath she in household work
    Her hands are soft and white

    Yet well by loving looks and ways
    She doth her cost requite

    So up they walked through Boston town

    And met a maiden fair
    A little basket on her arm

    So snowywliite and bare

    Come hither child and say hast thou
    This young man ever seen

    They wept within each others arms
    The page and young Kathleen

    Oh give to me this darling child
    And take my purse of gold

    Nay not by me her master said
    Shall sweet Kathleen be sold

    We loved her in the place of one

    The Lord hath early taen
    But since her heart s in Ireland

    We give her back again

    Oh for that same the saints in heaven

    For his poor soul shall pray
    And Mary Mother wash with tears

    His heresies away

    Sure novif they dwell in Ireland

    As you go up Claremore
    Ye II see their castle looking down

    The pleasant Galway shore

    And the old lords wife is dead and gone

    And a happy man is he
    For he sits beside his own Kathleen

    With her darling on his knee



    THE WELL OF LOCH MAREE

    Pennant in his Voyage to the Hebrides de
    scribes the holy well of Loch Maree the waters
    of which were supposed to efFect a miraculous
    cure of melancholy trouble and insanity

    Calm on the breast of Loch Maree

    A little isle reposes
    A shadow woven of the oak

    And willow oer it closes

    Within a Druids mound is seen
    Set round with stony warders

    A fountain gushing through the turf
    Flows oer its grassy borders

    And whoso bathes therein his brow
    With care or madness burning

    Feels once again his healthful thought
    And sense of peace returning

    O restless heart and fevered brain

    Unquiet and unstable
    That holy well of Loch Maree

    Is more than idle fable

    Lifes changes vex its discords stun
    Its glaring sunshine blindeth

    And blest is he who on liis way
    That fount of healingf findeth



    The shadows of a humbled will
    And C9ntrite heart are oer it

    Go read its legend  Trust in God
    On Faiths white stones before it



    THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS

    The incident upon whieli this poem is based
    is related in a note to Bernardin Henri Saint
    Pierres Etudes de la Nature

    We arrived at the habitation of the Her
    mits a little before they sat down to their table
    and while they were still at church J J
    Rousseau proposed to me to offer up our devo
    tions The hermits were reciting the Litanies
    of Providence which are remarkably beautiful
    After we had addressed our prayers to God
    and the hermits were proceeding to the refec
    tory Rousseau said to me with his heart
    overflowing  At this moment I experience
    what is said in the gospel  Where two or three
    are gathered together in my name there am I in
    the midst of them There is here a feeling of
    peace and happiness which penetrates the soul
    I said  li Fnelon had lived you would have
    been a Catholic He exclaimed with tears in
    his eyes  Oh if Fnelon were alive I would
    struggle to get into his service even as a
    lackey

    In my sketch of Saint Pierre it will be seen
    that I have somewhat antedated the period of
    his old age At that time he was not probably
    more than fifty In describing him I have by
    no means exaggerated his own history of his
    mental condition at the period of the story
    In the fragmentary Sequel to his Studies of
    Nature he thus speaks of himself The in
    gratitude of those of whom I had deserved
    kindness unexpected family misfortunes the
    total loss of my small patrimony through en
    terprises solely undertaken for the benefit of
    my country the debts under which I lay op
    pressed the blasting of all my hopes  these
    combined calamities made dreadful inroads
    upon my health and reason  I found it
    impossible to continue in a room where there
    was company especially if the doors Avere shut
    I could not even cross an alley in a public gar
    den if several persons had got together in it
    When alone my malady subsided I felt my
    self likewise at ease in places where I saw chil
    dren only At the siglit of any one Avalking
    up to the place where I was I felt my whole
    frame agitated and retired I often said to
    myself  Mj sole study has been to merit well
    of mankind  why do I fear them

    He attributes his improved health of mind
    and body to the counsels of his friend J J
    Rousseau  I renounced says he  my books

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    I threw my eyes upon the works o nature
    which spake to all my senses a language which
    neither tiine nor nations have it in their jwwer
    to alter Thenceforth my histories and my
    journals were the herhage of the fields and
    meadows My thoughts did not go forth pain
    fully after them as in the case of human
    systems  hut their thoughts under a thousand
    engaging forms quietly sought me In these
    I studied without effort the laws of that Uni
    versal Wisdom which had surrounded me from
    the cradle hut on which heretofore I had be
    stowed little attention

    Speaking of Rousseau he says   I derived
    inexpressible satisfaction from his society
    What I prized still more than his genius was
    his probity He was one of the few literary
    characters tried in the furnace of affliction to
    whom you could with perfect seciirity confide
    your most secret thoughts    Even when he
    deviated and became the victim of himself or
    of others he could forget his own misery in
    devotion to the welfare of mankind He Avas
    uniformly the advocate of the miserable
    There might be inscribed on his toml these
    affecting words from that Book of wliich he
    carried always about him some select passages
    during the last years of his life  His sins
    which are many are forgiven for he loved
    much

    I DO believe and yet in grief
    I pray for lielp to unbelief
    For needful strength aside to lay
    The daily cumberings of my way

    I m sick at heart of craft and cant
    Sick of the crazed enthusiasts rant
    Professions smooth hypocrisies
    And creeds of iron and lives of ease

    I ponder oer the sacred word
    I read the record of our Lord
    And weak and troubled envy them
    Who touched His seamless garments
    hem

    Who saw the tears of love He wept
    Above the grave where Lazarus slejjt
    And heard amidst the shadows dim
    Of Olivet His evening hymn

    How blessed the swineherds low estate
    The beggar crouching at the gate
    The leper loathly and abhorred
    Whose eyes of flesh beheld the Lord

    O sacred soil His sandals pressed
    Sweet fountains of His noonday rest



    light and air of Palestine
    Impregnate with His life divine

    Oh bear me thither  Let me look
    On Siloas pool and Kedrous brook
    Kneel at Getbsemane and by
    Genuesaret walk before I die

    Methuiks this cold and northern night
    Would melt before that Orient light
    And wet by Hermons dew and rain
    My childhoods faith revive again

    So spake my friend one autumn day
    Where the still river slid away
    Beneath us and above the brown
    Red curtains of the woods shut down

    Then said I  for I could not brook
    The mute appealing of his look
    I too am weak and faith is small
    And blindness happeneth unto all

    Yet sometimes glimpses on my sight
    Through present wrong the eternal right
    And step by step since time began

    1 see the steady gain of man

    That all of good the past hath had
    Remains to make our own time glad
    Our common daily life divine
    And every land a Palestine

    Thou weariest of thy present state
    What gain to thee times holiest date
    The doubter now perchance had been
    As High Priest or as Pilate then

    What thought Chorazins scribes  What

    faith
    In Him had Nain and Nazareth
    Of the few followers whom He led
    One sold Him  all forsook and lied

    O friend  we need nor Iock nor sand
    Nor storied stream of MorningLand
    The heavens are glassed in Merrimac
    What more could Jordan render back

    We lack but open eye and ear
    To find the Orients marvels here
    The still small voice iu autumns hush
    Yon maple wood the burning bush

    For still the new transcends the old
    In signs and tokens manifold



    THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS



    41



    Slaves rise up men  the olive waves
    With roots deep set in battle graves

    Through the harsh noises of our day
    A low sweet prelude finds its way
    Through clouds of doubt and creeds of

    fear
    A light is breaking calm and clear

    That song of Love now low and far
    Erelong shall swell from star to star
    That light the breaking day which tips
    The goldenspired Apocalypse

    Then when my good friend shook his head
    And sighing sadly smiled I said
    Thou mindst me of a story told
    In rare Beruardins leaves of gold

    And while the slanted smibeams wove
    The shadows of the froststaiiied grove
    And picturing all the river ran
    Oer cloud and wood I thus began



    Li Mount Valeriens chestnut wood
    The Chapel of the Plermits stood
    And thither at the close of day
    Came two old pilgrims worn and gray

    One whose impetuous youth defied
    The storms of Baikals wintry side
    And mused and dreamed where tropic day
    Flamed oer his lost Virginias bay

    His simple tale of love and woe
    All hearts had melted high or low
    A blissful pain a sweet distress
    Immortal in its tenderness

    Yet while above his charmed page
    Beat quick the young heart of his age
    He walked amidst the crowd unknown
    A sorrowing old man strange and lone

    A homeless troubled age  the gray
    Pale setting of a weary day
    Too dull his car for voice of praise
    Too sadly worn his brow for bays

    Ride Inst of power and glory slept
    Yet still his lieart its young dream kept
    And wandering like the delugedove
    Still sought the restingplace of love



    And mateless childless envied inore
    The peasants welcome from his door
    By smiling eyes at eventide
    Thau kingly gifts or lettered pride

    Until in place of wife and child
    Allpitying Nature on him smiled
    And gave to him the golden keys
    To all her inmost sanctities

    Mild Druid of her woodpaths dim
    She laid her great heart bare to him
    Its loves and sweet accords   he saw
    The beauty of her perfect law

    The language of her signs he knew
    What notes her cloudy clarion blew
    The rhythm of autumns forest djes
    The hymn of sunsets painted skies

    And thus he seemed to hear the song
    Which swept of old the stars along
    And to his eyes the earth once more
    Its fresh and primal beauty wore

    Who sought with him from summer

    air
    And field and wood a balm for care
    And bathed in light of sunset skies
    His tortured nerves and weary eyes

    His fame on all the winds had flown
    His words had sliaken crypt and throne
    Like fire on camp and court and cell
    They dropped and kindled as they fell

    Beneath the pomps of state below
    The mitred jugglers masque and show
    A prophecy a vague hope ran
    His burning thought from man to man

    For peace or rest too well he saw
    The fraud of priests the wrong of law
    And felt how hard between the two
    Their breath of pain the millions drew

    A prophetutterance strong and wild
    The weakness of an unweaned child
    A sunbright hope for humankind
    And selfdespair in him combined

    He loathed the false yet lived not true
    To half the glorious truths he knew
    The doubt the discord and the sin
    He mourned without he felt within

    Uutrod by him the path he showed
    Sweet pictures on his easel glowed
    Of simple faith and loves of home
    And virtues golden days to come

    But weakness shame and folly made
    The foil to all his pen portrayed
    Still where his dreamy splendors shone
    The shadow of himself was thrown

    Lord wliat is man whose thought at times
    Up to Thy sevenfold brightness climbs
    While still his grosser instinct clings
    To earth like other creeping things

    So rich in words in acts so mean

    So high so low  chanceswung between

    The foulness of tlie penal pit

    And Truths clear sky millenniumlit

    Vain pride of starlent genius   vain
    Quick fancy and creative brain
    Unblest by prayerful sacrifice
    Absurdly great or weakly wise

    Midst yearnings for a truer life
    Without were fears vithin was strife
    And still his wayward act denied
    The perfect good for which he sighed

    The love he sent forth void returned
    The fame that crowned him scorched and

    burned
    Burning yet cold and drear and lone
    A firemount in a frozen zone I

    Like that the grayhaired seaking passed
    Seen southward from his sleety mast
    About whose brows of changeless frost
    A wreath of flame the vnld winds tossed

    Far round the mournful beauty played
    Of lambent light and purple shade
    Lost on the fixed and dumb despair
    Of frozen earth and sea and air

    A man apart unknown unloved
    By those whose vrongs his soul had moved
    He bore the ban of Church and State
    The good mans fear the bigots hate

    Forth from the citys noise and throng
    Its pomp and shame its sin and wrong
    The twain that summer day liad strayed
    To Mount Valeriens chestnut shade



    To them the green fields and the wood
    Lent something of their quietude
    And goldentinted sunset seemed
    Prophetical of all they dreamed

    The hermits from their simple cares
    The bell was calling home to prayers
    And listening to its sound the twain
    Seemed lapped in childhoods trust again

    Wide open stood the chapel door

    A sweet old music swelling oer

    Low prayerful murmurs issued thence

    The Litanies of Providence

    Then Rousseau spake   Where two or

    three
    In His name meet He there will be
    And then in silence on their knees
    They sank beneath the chestnuttrees

    As to the blind returning light
    As daybreak to the Arctic night
    Old faith revived  the doubts of years
    Dissolved in reverential tears

    That gush of feeling overpast
    Ah me   Bernardin sighed at last
    I would thy bitterest foes could see
    Thy heart as it is seen of me

    No church of God hast thou denied
    Thou hast but spurned in scorn aside
    A bare and hollow counterfeit
    Profaning the pure name of it

    With dry dead moss and marish weeds
    His fire the western herdsman feeds
    And greener from the ashen plain
    The sweet spring grasses rise again

    Nor thunderpeal nor mighty wind
    Disturb the solid sky behind
    And through the cloud the red bolt rends
    The calm still smile of Heaven descends

    Thus through the world like bolt and

    blast
    And scourging fire thy words have passed
    Clouds break  the steadfast heavens re

    main
    Weeds burn  the ashes feed the grain

    But whoso strives with wrong may find
    Its touch pollute its darkness blind



    THE CHAPEL OF THE HERMITS



    43



    And learn as latent fraud is shown
    In others faith to doubt his own

    With dream and falsehood simple trust
    And pious hope we tread in dust
    Lost the calm faith in goodness  lost
    The baptism of the Pentecost

    Alas   the blows for error meant
    Too oft on truth itself are spent
    As through the false and vile and base
    Looks forth her sad rebuking face

    Not ours the Thebans charmed life
    We come not scathless from the strife
    The Pythons coil pbout us clings
    The trampled Hydra bites and stings

    Meanwhile the sport of seeming chance
    The plastic shapes of circumstance
    What might have been we fondly gness
    If earlier born or tempted less

    And thou in these wild troubled days
    Misjudged alike in blame and praise
    Unsought and undeserved the same
    The skeptics praise the bigots blame

    I cannot doubt if thou hadst been
    Among the higldy favored men
    Who walked on earth with Fnelon
    He would have owned thee as his son

    And bright with wings of cherubim

    Visibly waving over him

    Seen through his life the Church had

    seemed
    All that its old confessors dreamed

    I would have been Jean Jacques re
    plied
    The humblest servant at his side
    Obscure unknown content to see
    How beautiful mans life may be

    Oh more than thriceblest relic more
    Than solemn rite or sacred lore
    The holy life of one who trod
    The footmarks of the Christ of God

    Amidst a blinded world he saw
    The oneness of the Dual law
    That Heavens sweet peace on Earth be
    gan
    And God was loved throujrh love of man



    He lived the Truth which reconciled
    The strong man Reason Faith the child
    In him belief and act were one
    Tlie homilies of duty done

    So speaking through the twilight gray
    The two old pilgrims went their way
    What seeds of life that day were sown
    The heavenly watchers knew alone

    Time passed and Autumn came to fold
    Green Summer in her brown and gold
    Time passed and Winters tears of snow
    Dropped on the gravemound of Rousseau

    The tree remaineth where it fell
    The pained on earth is pained in hell
    So priestcraft from its altars cursed
    The mournful doubts its falsehood nursed

    Ah  well of old the Psalmist prayed
    Thy hand not mans on me be laid
    Earth frowns below Heaven weeps above
    And man is hate but God is love

    No Hermits now the wanderer sees
    Nor chapel with its chestnuttrees
    A morning dream a tale that s told
    The wave of change oer all has rolled

    Yet lives the lesson of that day
    And from its twilight cool and gray
    Comes up a low sad whisper  Make
    The truth thine own for truths own
    sake

    Why wait to see in thy brief span
    Its perfect flower and fruit in man
    No saintly touch can save  no balm
    Of healing bath the martyrs palm

    Midst soulless forms and false pretence
    Of spiritual pride and pampered sense
    A voice saith  What is that to thee
    Be true thyself and follow Me

    In days when throne and altar heard
    The wantons wish the bigots word
    And pomp of state and ritual sliow
    Scarce hid the loathsome death below

    Midst fawning priests and courtiers foul
    Tlie losel swarm of crown and cowl
    Whiterobed walked Francois Fdnelon
    Staiidess as Uriel in the sun

    Yet in bis time the stake blazed red
    The poor were eaten up like bread
    Men knew him not  his garments hem
    No healing virtue had for them

    Alas  no present saint we find
    The white cymar gleams far behind
    Revealed in outline vagne sublime
    Through telescopic mists of time

    Trust not in man with passing breath

    But in the Lord old Scripture saith

    The truth which saves thou mayest not

    blend
    With false professor faithless friend

    Search thine own heart What paineth

    thee
    In others in thyself may be
    All dust is frail all flesh is weak
    Be thou the true man thou dost seek

    Where now with pain thou treadest

    trod
    The whitest of the saints of God
    To show thee where their feet were set
    The light which led them shineth yet

    The footprints of the life divine
    Which marked their path remain in thine
    And that great Life transfused in theirs
    Awaits thy faith thy love thy prayers

    A lesson which I well may heed
    A word of fitness to my need
    So from that twilight cool and gray
    Still saith a voice or seems to say



    We rose and slowly homeward turned
    While down the west the sunset bnrned
    And in its light hill wood and tide
    And human forms seemed glorified

    The village homes transfigured stood
    And purple bluflts whose belting wood
    Across the waters leaned to hold
    The yellow leaves like lamps of gold

    Then spake my friend   Thy words are

    true
    Forever old forever new
    These homeseen splendors are the same
    Which over Edens sunsets came



    To these bowed heavens let wood and

    hill
    Lift voiceless praise and anthem still
    Fall warm with blessing over them
    Light of the New Jerusalem

    Flow on sweet river like the stream
    Of Johns Apocalyptic dream
    This mapled ridge shall Horeb be
    Yon greenbanked lake our Galilee

    Henceforth my heart shall sigh no more
    For olden time and holier shore
    Gods love and blessing then and there
    Are now and here and everywhere



    TAULER

    Tauler the preacher walked one au
    tumn day
    Without the walls of Strasburg by the

    Rhine
    Pondering the solemn Miracle of Life
    As one who wandering in a starless night
    Feels momently the jar of unseen waves
    And hears the thunder of an unknovn sea
    Breaking along an unimagined shore

    And as he walked he prayed Even the

    same
    Old prayer with which for half a score of

    years
    Morning and noon and evening lip and

    heart
    Had groaned   Have pity upon me Lord
    Thou seest while teaching others I am

    blind
    Send me a man who can direct my steps

    Then as he mused he heard along his

    path
    A sound as of an old mans staff among
    The dry dead lindenleaves  and looking

    up
    He saw a stranger weak and poor and

    old

    Peace be unto thee father   Tauler

    said
    God give thee a good day   The old

    man raised
    Slowly his calm blue eyes  I thank thee

    son
    But all my days are good and none are ill



    THE HERMIT OF THE THEBAID



    45



    Wondering thereat the preacher spake
    again
    God give thee happy life The old man

    smiled
    I never am unhappy

    Tauler laid
    His hand upon the strangers coarse gray

    sleeve
    Tell me O father vfhat thy strange words

    mean
    Surely mans days are evil and his life
    Sad as the grave it leads to  Nay my

    son
    Our times are in Gods hands and all our

    days
    Are as our needs  for shadow as for sun
    For cold as heat for want as wealth alike
    Our thanks are due since that is best which

    And that which is not sharing not His life
    Is evil only as devoid of good
    And for the happiness of which I spake
    I find it in submission to His will
    And calm trust in the holy Trinity
    Of Knowledge Goodness and Almighty
    Power

    Silently wondering for a little space
    Stood the great preacher  then he spake

    as one
    Who suddenly grappling with a haunting

    thought
    Which long has followed whispering

    through the dark
    Strange terrors drags it shrieking into

    light
    What if Gods will consign thee hence to

    Hell

    Then said the stranger cheerily  be

    it so
    What Hell may be I know not  this I

    know
    I cannot lose the presence of the Lord
    One arm Humility takes hold upon
    His dear humanity  the other Love
    Clasps his Divinity So where I go
    He goes  and better firewalled Hell with

    Him
    Than goldengated Paradise without

    Tears sprang in Taulers eyes A sud
    den light
    Like the first ray which fell on chaos clove



    Apart the shadow wherein he had walked
    Darkly at noon And as the strange old

    man
    Went his slow way until his silver hair
    Set like the white moon where the hills of

    vine
    Slope to the Rhine he bowed his head and

    said
    My prayer is answered God hath sent

    the man
    Long sought to teach me by his simple

    trust
    Wisdom the weary schoolmen never knew

    So entering with a changed and cheer
    ful step
    The city gates he saw far down the street
    A mighty shadow break the light of noon
    WhicTi tracing backward till its airy lines
    Hardened to stony plinths he raised his eyes
    Oer broad facjade and lofty pediment
    Oer architrave and frieze and sainted niche
    Up the stone lacework chiselled by the

    wise
    Erwiu of Steinbach dizzily up to where
    In the noonbrightness the great Minsters

    tower
    Jewelled with sunbeams on its mural crown
    Rose like a visible prayer  Behold   he

    said
    The strangers faith made plain before

    mine eyes
    As yonder tower outstretches to the earth
    The dark triangle of its shade alone
    When the clear day is shining on its top
    So darkness in the pathway of Mans life
    Is but the shadow of Gods providence
    By the great Sun of Wisdom cast thereon
    And what is dark below is light iu Heaven



    THE HERMIT OF THE THEBAID

    O STRONG upwelling prayers of faith
    From inmost founts of life ye start

    The spirits pulse the vital breath
    Of soul and heart

    From pastoral toil from traffics din
    Alone in crowds at home abroad

    Unheard of man ye enter in
    The ear of God

    Ye brook no forced and measured tasks
    Nor weary rote nor formal chains

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    The simple heart that freely asks
    In love obtains

    For man the living temple is

    The mercyseat and cherubim
    And all the holy mysteries

    He bears with him

    And most avails the prayer of love

    Which wordless shapes itself in deeds

    And wearies Heaven for naught above
    Our common needs

    Which brings to Gods allperfect will
    That trust of His undoubting child

    Whereby all seeming good and ill
    Are reconciled

    And seeking not for special signs

    Of favor is content to fall
    Within the providence which shines

    And rains on all

    Alone the Thebaid hermit leaned
    At noontime oer the sacred word

    Was it an angel or a fiend
    Whose voice he heard

    It broke the deserts hush of awe
    A human utterance sweet and mild

    And looking up the hermit saw
    A little child

    A child with wonderwidened eyes
    Oerawed and troubled by the sight

    Of hot red sands and brazen skies
    And anchorite

    What dost thou here poor man  No
    shade
    Of cool green palms nor grass nor
    well
    Nor corn nor vines The hermit said
    With God I dwell

    Alone with Him in this great calm
    I live not by the outward sense

    My Nile his love my sheltering palm
    His providence

    The child gazed round him  Does God
    live

    Here only   where the deserts rim
    Is green with corn at morn and eve

    We pray to Him



    My brother tills beside the Nile
    His little field  beneath the leaves

    My sisters sit and spin the while
    My mother weaves

    And when the millets ripe heads fall
    And all the beanfield hangs in pod

    My mother smiles and says that all
    Are gifts from God

    And when to share our evening meal
    She calls the stranger at the door

    She says God fills the hands that deal
    Food to the poor

    Adown the hermits wasted cheeks
    Glistened the flow of human tears

    Dear Lord   he said  Thy angel speaks
    Thy servant hears

    Within his arms the child he took

    And thought of home and life with men

    And all his pilgrim feet forsook
    Returned again

    The palmy shadows cool and long

    The eyes that smiled through lavish
    locks

    Homes cradlehymn and harvestsong
    And bleat of flocks

    O child   he said  thou teaehest me
    There is no place where God is not

    That love will make whereer it be
    A holy spot

    He rose from off the desert sand
    And leaning on his stafi of thorn

    Went with the young child hand in hand
    Like night with morn

    They crossed the deserts burning line
    And heard the palmtrees rustling fan

    The Nilebirds cry the low of kine
    And voice of man

    Unquestioning his childish guide
    He followed as the small hand led

    To where a woman gentleeyed
    Her distaff fed

    She rose she clasped her truant boy

    She thanked the stranger with her eyes

    The hermit gazed in doubt and joy
    And dumb surprise

    MAUD MULLER

    The recollection of some descendants of a
    Hessian deserter in the Revolutionary war bear
    ing the name of Mnller doubtless suggested
    the somewhat infelicitous title of a New Eng
    land idyl The 5oem had no real foundation
    in fact though a hint of it may have been found
    in recalling an incident trivial in itself of a
    journey on the picturesque jSIaine seaboard
    with my sister some years before it was writ
    ten We had stopped to rest our tired horse
    under the shade of an appletree and refresh
    him with water from a little brook which
    rippled through the stone wall across the road
    A very beautiful young girl in seantest sum
    mer attire was at work in the hayfield and as
    we talked with her we noticed that she strove
    to hide her bare feet by raking hay over them
    blushing as she did so through the tan of her
    cheek and neck

    Maud Muller on a summers day
    Raked the meadow sweet with hay

    Beneath her torn hat glowed the health
    Of simple beauty and rustic health

    Singing she wrought and her merry glee
    The mockbird echoed from his tree



    But when she glanced to the faroff town
    White from its hillslope looking down

    The sweet song died and a vague unrest
    And a nameless longing tilled her breast

    A wish that she hardly dared to own
    For something better than she had known

    The Judge rpde slowly down the lane
    Smoothing his horses chestnut mane

    He drew his bridle in the shade

    Of the appletrees to greet the maid

    And asked a draught from the spring that

    ilowed
    Through the meadow across the road

    She stooped where the cool spring bubbled

    up
    And filled for him her small tin cup

    And blushed as she gave it looking down
    On her feet so bare and her tattered gown

    Thanks   said the Judge   a sweeter

    draught
    From a fairer hand was never quaffed

    He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees
    Of the singing birds and the humming bees

    Then talked of the haying and wondered

    whether
    The cloud in the west would bring foul

    weather

    And Maud forgot her briertorn govn
    And her graceful ankles bare and brown

    And listened while a pleased surprise
    Looked from her longlashed hazel eyes

    At last like one who for delay
    Seeks a vain excuse he rode away

    Maud Muller looked and sighed   Ah me
    That I the Judges bride might be

    He would dress me up in silks so fine
    And praise and toast me at his wine

    My father should wear a broadcloth coat
    My brother shouUl sail a painted boat

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    I d dress my mother so grand and gay
    And the baby should have a new toy each
    day

    And I d feed the hungry and clothe the

    poor
    And all sboidd bless me who left our door

    The Judge looked back as he climbed the

    hill
    And saw Maud MuUer standing still

    A form more fair a face more sweet
    Neer hath it been my lot to meet

    And her modest answer and graceful air
    Show her wise and good as she is fair

    Would she were mine and I today
    Like her a harvester of hay

    No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs
    Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues

    But low of cattle and song of birds
    And health and quiet and loving words

    But he thought of his sisters proud and

    cold
    And his mother vain of her rank and gold

    So closing his heart the Judge rode on
    And Maud was left in the field alone

    But the lawyers smiled that afternoon
    When he hummed in court an old love
    tune

    And the young girl mused beside the well
    Till the rain on the unraked clover fell

    He wedded a wife of richest dower
    Who lived for fashion as he for power

    Yet oft in his marble hearths bright glow
    He watched a picture come and go

    And sweet Maud Mullers hazel eyes
    Looked out in their innocent surprise

    Oft when the wine In his glass was red
    He longed for the wayside well instead

    And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
    To dream of meadows and cloverblooms



    And the proud man sighed with a secret

    pain
    Ah that I were free again

    Free as when I rode that day

    Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay

    She wedded a man unlearned and poor
    And many children played round her door

    But care and sorrow and childbirtli pain
    Left their traces on heart and brain

    And oft when the summer sun shone hot
    On the newmown hay in the meadow lot

    And she heard the little spring brook fall
    Over the roadside through the wall

    In the shade of the appletree again
    She saw a rider draw his rein

    And gazing down with timid grace
    She felt his pleased eyes read her face

    Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
    Stretched away into stately halls

    The weary wheel to a spinnet turned
    The tallow candle an astral burned

    And for him who sat by the chimney lug
    Dozing and grumbling oer pipe and mug

    A manly form at her side she saw
    And joy was duty and love was law

    Then she took up her burden of life again
    Saying only It might have been

    Alas for maiden alas for Judge

    For rich repiner and household drudge

    God pity them both  and pity us all
    Who vainly the dreams of youth recall

    For of all sad words of tongue or pen
    The saddest are these  It might have
    been

    Ah well  for us all some sweet hope lies
    Deeply buried from human eyes

    And in the hereafter angels may
    Roll the stone from its grave away

    There in wild and virgin freshness its

    waters foam and How
    As when Darby Field first saw them two

    hundred years ago

    But vexed in all its seaward course with

    bridges dams and mills
    How changed is Sacos stream how lost its

    freedom of the hills
    Since travelled Jocelyn factor Vines and

    stately Champernoon
    Heard on its banks the gray wolfs howl

    the trumpet of the loon

    With smoking axle hot with speed with
    steeds of fire and steam

    Widewaked Today leaAes Yesterday be
    hind him like a dream

    Still from the hurrying tiain of Life fly
    backward far and fast

    The milestones of the fathers the land
    marks of the past

    But human hearts remain unchanged  the

    sorrow and the sin
    The loves and hopes and fears of old are to

    our own akin
    And if in tales our fathers told the songs

    our mothers sung
    Tradition wears a snowy beard Romance

    is always young

    O sharplined man of traffic on Sacos
    banks today

    O millgirl watching late and long the
    shuttles restless play

    Let for the once a listening ear the work
    ing hand beguile

    And lend my old Provincial tale as suits
    a tear or smile



    The evening gun had sounded from gray

    Fort Marys walls
    Through the forest like a wild beast

    roared and plmiged the Sacos

    falls



    And westward on the seawind that damp

    and gusty grew
    Over cedars darkening inland the smokes

    of Spur wink blew

    On the hearth of Farmer Garvin blazed

    the crackling walnut log
    Right and left sat dame and goodman and

    between them lay the dog

    Head on paws and tail slow wagging and

    beside him on her mat
    Sitting drowsy in the firelight winked and

    purred the mottled cat

    Twenty years  said Goodman Garvin
    speaking sadly under breath
    And his gray head slowly shaking as one
    who speaks of death

    The goodwife dropped her needles   It is

    twenty years today
    Since the Indians fell on Saco and stole our

    child away

    Then they sank into the silence for each

    knew the others thought
    Of a great and common sorrow and words

    were needed not

    Who knocks   cried Goodman Garvin

    The door was open thrown
    On two strangers man and maiden cloaked

    and furred the firelight shone

    One with courteous gesture lifted the bear
    skin from his head

    Lives here Elkanah Garvin   I am
    he the goodman said

    Sit ye down and dry and warm ye for
    the night is chill with rain

    And the goodwife drew the settle and
    stirred the fire amain

    The maid unclasped her cloakhood the

    firelight glistened fair
    In her large moist eyes and over soft folds

    of dark brown hair

    Dame Garvin looked upon her   It is

    Marys self I see
    Dear heart   she cried  now tell

    me has my child come back to

    me

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    My name indeed is Mary said the

    stranger sobbing wild
    Will you be to me a motlier  I am

    Mary Garvins child

    She sleeps by wooded Simcoe but on her

    dying day
    She bade my father take me to her kinsfolk

    far away

    And when the priest besought her to do

    me no such wrong
    She said  May God forgive me  I have

    closed my heart too long

    When I hid me from my father and shut

    out my mothers call
    I sinned against those dear ones and the

    Father of us all

    Christs love rebukes no home love
    breaks no tie of kin apart

    Better heresy in doctrine than heresy of
    heart

    Tell me not the Church must cen
    sure  she who wept the Cross be
    side

    Never made her own flesh strangers nor
    the claims of blood denied

    And if she who wronged her parents
    with her child atones to them

    Earthly daughter Heavenly Mother  thou
    at least wilt not condemn

    So upon her deathbed lying my blessed

    mother spake
    As we come to do her bidding so receive

    us for her sake

    God be praised   said Goodwife Garvin
    He taketh and He gives

    He woundeth biit He healeth  in her
    child our daughter lives

    Amen   the old man answered as he

    brushed a tear away
    And kneeling by his hearthstone said with

    reverence  Let us pray

    All its Oriental symbols and its Hebrew

    paraphrase
    Warm with earnest life and feeling rose

    his prayer of love and praise



    But he started at beholding as he rose

    from off his knee
    The stranger cross his forehead with the

    sign of Papistrie

    What is this   cried Farmer Garvin

    Is an English Christians home
    A chapel or a masshouse that you make

    the sign of Rome

    Then the young girl knelt beside him kissed
    his trembling hand and cried

    Oh forbear to chide my father  in that
    faith my mother died

    On her wooden cross at Simcoe the dews

    and sunshine fall
    As they fall on Spurwinks graveyard  and

    the dear God watches all

    The old man stroked the fair head that

    rested on his knee
    Your words dear child he answered

    are Gods rebuke to me

    Creed and rite perchance may differ yet
    our faith and hope be one

    Let me be your fathers father let him be
    to me a son

    When the horn on Sabbath morning
    through the still and frosty air

    From Spurwink Pool and Black Point
    called to sermon and to prayer

    To the goodly house of worship where in

    order due and fit
    As by public vote directed classed and

    ranked the people sit

    Mistress first and goodwife after clerkly

    squire before the clown
    From the brave coat laceembroidered to

    the gray frock shading down

    From the pulpit read the preacher  Good
    man Garvin and his wife

    Fain would thank the Lord whose kind
    ness has followed them through
    life

    For the great and crowning mercy that
    their daughter from the wild

    Where she rests they hope in Gods peace
    has sent to them her child



    THE RANGER

    And the prayers of all Gods people they

    ask that tliej may prove
    Not unworthy tlirough their weakness of

    such special proof of love

    As the preacher prayed uprising the aged

    couple stood
    And the fair Canadian also in her modest

    maidenhood

    Thought the elders grave and doubting
    She is Papist born and bred

    Thought the young men  T is an angel in
    Mary Garvins stead

    THE RANGER

    Originally published as Martha Mason a
    Song of the Old French War

    Robert Rawlin   Frosts were falling
    When the rangers horn was calling

    Through the woods to Canada
    Gone the winters sleet and snowing
    Gone the springtimes bud and blowing
    Gone the summers harvest mowing

    And again the fields are gray

    Yet away he s away
    Faint and fainter hope is growing

    In the hearts that mourn his stay

    Where the lion crouching high on
    Abrahams rock with teeth of iron

    Glares oer wood and wave away
    Faintly thence as pines far sighing
    Or as thunder spent and dying
    Come the challenge and replying

    Come the sounds of flight and fray

    Welladay  Hope and pray
    Some are living some are lying

    In their red graves far away

    Straggling rangers worn with dangers
    Homeward faring weary strangers

    Pass the farmgate on their way
    Tidings of the dead and living
    Forest march and ambush giving
    Till the maidens leave their weaving

    And the lads forget their play

    Still away still away
    Sighs a sad one sick with grieving

    Why does Robert still delay

    Nowhere fairer sweeter rarer
    Does the goldenlocked fruit bearer



    Through liis painted woodlands stray
    Than where hillside oaks and beeches
    Overlook the long blue reaches
    Silver coves and pebbled beaches

    And green isles of Casco Bay

    Nowhere day for delay
    With a tenderer look beseeches

    Let me with my charmed eartli stay

    On the grainlands of the mainlands
    Stands the serried corn like trainbands

    Plume and pennon rustling gay
    Out at sea the islands wooded
    Silver birches goldenhooded
    Set with maples crimsonblooded

    White seafoam and sandhills gray

    Stretch away far away
    Dim and dreamy overbrooded

    By the hazy autumn day

    Gayly chattering to the clattering

    Of the brown nuts downward pattering

    Leap the squirrels red and gray
    On the grassland on the fallow
    Drop the apples red and yellow
    Drop the russet pears and mellow

    Drop the red leaves all the day

    And away swift away
    Sun and cloud oer hill and hollow

    Chasing weave their web of play

    Martha Mason Martha Mason
    Prithee tell us of the reason

    Why you mope at home today
    Surely smiling is not sinning
    Leave your quilling leave your spinning
    What is all your store of linen

    If your heart is never gay

    Come away come away
    Never yet did sad beginning

    Make the task of life a play

    Overbending till she s blending
    With the flaxen skein she s tending

    Pale brown tresses smoothed away
    From her face of patient sorrow
    Sits she seeking but to borrow
    From the trembling hope of morrow

    Solace for the weary day

    Go your way laugh and play
    Unto Him who heeds the sparrow

    Join us   cried the laugliing May
    To the beach we all are going
    And to save the task of rowing
    West by north the wind is blowing

    Blowing briskly down the bay

    Come away come away
    Time and tide are swiftly flowing

    Let us take them while we may

    Never tell us that you 11 fail us
    Where the purple beachplum mellows

    On the bluffs so wild and gray
    Hasten for the oars are falling
    Hark our merry mates are calling
    Time it is that we were all in

    Singing tideward down the bay

    Nay nay let me stay
    Sore and sad for Robert Rawlin

    Is my heart she said  today

    Vain your calling for Rob Rawlin
    Some red squaw his moosemeat s broiling

    Or some French lass singing gay
    Just forget as he s forgetting
    What avails a life of fretting
    If some stars must needs be setting

    Others rise as good as they

    Cease I pray  go your way
    Martha cries her eyelids wetting

    Foul and false the words you say

    Martha Mason hear to reason
    Prithee put a kinder face on

    Cease to vex me did she say
    Better at his side be lying
    With the mournful pinetrees sighing
    And the wild birds oer us crying

    Than to doubt like mine a prey

    AVhile away far away
    Turns my heart forever trying

    Some new hope for each new day

    When the shadows veil the meadows
    And the sunsets golden ladders

    Sink from twilights walls of gray
    From the window of my dreaming
    I can see his sickle gleaming
    Cheeryvoiced can hear him teaming

    Down the locustshaded way

    But away swift away
    Fades the fond delusive seeming

    And I kneel again to pray

    When the growing dawn is showing
    And the barnyard cock is crowing



    And the horned moon pales away
    From a dream of him awaking
    Every sound my heart is making
    Seems a footstep of his taking

    Then I hush the thought and say

    Nay nay he s away
    Ah  my heart my heart is breaking

    For the dear one far away

    Look up Martha  worn and swarthy
    Glows a face of manhood worthy

    Robert    Martha   all they say
    Oer went wheel and reel together
    Little cared the owner whither
    Heart of lead is heart of feather

    Noon of night is noon of day

    Come away come away
    When such lovers meet each others

    Why should prying idlers stay

    Quench the timbers fallen embers
    Quench the red leaves in Decembers

    Hoary rime and chilly spray
    But the hearth shall kindle clearer
    Household welcomes sound siucerer
    Heart to loving heart draw nearer

    When the bridal bells shall say

    Hope and pray trust alvvay
    Life is sweeter love is dearer

    For the trial and delay



    THE GARRISON OF CAPE ANN

    From the hills of home forth looking far

    beneath the tentlike span
    Of the sky I see the white gleam of the

    headland of Cape Ann
    Well I know its coves and beaches to the

    ebbtide glimmering down
    And the whitewalled handet children of

    its ancient fishingtown

    Long has passed the summer morning and

    its memory waxes old
    When along yon breezy headlands with a

    pleasant friend I strolled
    Ah  the autumn sun is shining and the

    ocean wind blows cool
    And the goldenrod and aster bloom around

    thy grave Rantoid

    With the memory of that morning by the
    summer sea I blend



    THE GARRISON OF CAPE ANN



    53



    A wild and wondrous story by the younger

    Mather penned
    In that quaint Magnalia Christi with all

    strange and marvellous things
    Heaped up huge and undigested like the

    chaos Ovid sings

    Dear to me these far faint glimpses of the

    dual life of old
    Inward grand with awe and reverence

    outward mean and coarse and

    cold
    Gleams of mystic beauty playing over dull

    and vulgar clay
    Goldenthreaded fancies weaving in a web

    of hodden gray

    The great eventful Present hides the Past

    but through the din
    Of its loud life hints and echoes from the

    life behind steal in
    And the lore of home and fiieside and the

    legendary rhyme
    Make the task of duty lighter which the

    true man owes his time

    So with something of the feeling which
    the Covenanter knew

    When with pious chisel wandering Scot
    lands moorland graveyards through

    From the graves of old traditions I part
    the blackberryvines

    Wipe the moss from off the headstones
    and retouch the faded lines



    Where the seawaves back and for
    ward hoarse with rolling pebbles
    ran

    The garrisonhouse stood watching on the
    gray rocks of Cape Ann

    On its windy site uplifting gabled roof and
    palisade

    And rough walls of unhewn timber with
    the moonlight overlaid

    On his slow round walked the sentry south

    and eastward looking forth
    Oer a rude and broken coastline white

    with breakers stretching north
    Wood and rock and gleaming sanddrift

    jagged capes with bush and tree
    Leaning inland from the smiting of the

    wild and gusty sea



    Before the deepmouthed chimney dimly

    lit by dying brands
    Twenty soldiers sat and waited with their

    muskets in their hands
    On the roughhewn oaken table the venison

    haunch was shared
    And the pewter tankard circled slowly

    roimd from beard to beard

    Long they sat and talked together

    talked of wizards Satansold
    Of all ghostly sights and noises  signs

    and wonders manifold
    Of the spectreship of Salem with the dead

    men in her shrouds
    Sailing sheer above the water in the loom of

    morning clouds

    Of the marvellous valley hidden in the

    depths of Gloucester woods
    Full of plants that love the summer

    blooms of warmer latitudes
    Where the Arctic birch is braided by the

    tropics flowery vines
    And the white magnoliablossoms star the

    twilight of the pines

    But their voices sank yet lower sank to

    husky tones of fear
    As they spake of present tokens of the

    powers of evil near
    Of a spectral host defying stroke of steel

    and aim of gun
    Never yet was ball to slay them in the

    mould of mortals run

    Thrice with plumes and flowing scalplocks
    from the midnight wood they
    came

    Thrice around the blockhouse march
    ing met unharmed its volleyed
    flame

    Then with mocking laugh and gesture
    sunk in earth or lost in air

    All the ghostly wonder vanished and the
    moonlit sands lay bare

    Midnight came  from out the forest moved

    a dusky mass that soon
    Grew to warriois plumed and painted

    grimly marching in the moon
    Ghosts or witches  said the captain

    thus I foil the Evil One
    And he rammed a silver button from his

    doublet down his gun



    54



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Once again the spectral horror moved the

    guarded wall about
    Once again the levelled muskets through

    the palisades flashed out
    With that deadly aim the squirrel ou his

    treetop might not shun
    Nor the beachbird seaward flying with his

    slant wing to the sun

    Like the idle rain of summer sped the harm
    less shower of lead

    With a laugh of fierce derision once again
    the phantoms fled

    Once again without a shadow on the sands
    the moonlight lay

    And the white smoke curling through it
    drifted slowly down the bay

    God ireserve us   said the captain

    never mortal foes were there
    They have vanished with their leader

    Prince and Power of the air
    Lay aside jour useless weapons  skill and

    prowess naught avail
    They who do the Devils service wear their

    masters coat of mail

    So the night grew near to cockcrow when
    again a warning call

    Roused the score of weary soldiers watch
    ing round the dusky hall

    And they looked to flint and priming and
    they longed for break of day

    But the captain closed his Bible   Let us
    cease from man and pray

    To the men who went before us all the un
    seen powers seemed near

    And their steadfast strength of courage
    struck its roots in holy fear

    Every hand forsook the musket every head
    was bowed and bare

    Every stout knee pressed the flagstones as
    the captain led in prayer

    Ceased thereat the mystic marching of the

    spectres round the wall
    But a souiul abhorred unearthly smote the

    ears and hearts of all
    Howls of rage and shrieks of anguish

    Never after mortal man
    Saw the ghostly leaguers marching round

    the blockhouse of Cape Ann

    So to us who walk in summer through the
    cool and seablown town



    From the childhood of its people comes the

    solemn legend down
    Not in vain the ancient fiction iu whose

    moral lives the youth
    And the fitness and the freshness of an un

    decayiug truth

    Soon or late to all our dwellings come the

    spectres of the mind
    Doubts and fears and dread forebodings

    in the darkness imdefined
    Round us throng the grim projections of the

    heart and of the brain
    And our pride of strength is weakness and

    the cunning hand is vain

    In the dark we cry like children  and no

    answer from on high
    Breaks the crystal sjheres of silence and

    no white wings downward fly
    But the heavenly help we pray for comes to

    faith and not to sight
    And our prayers themselves drive backward

    all the spirits of the night



    THE GIFT OF TRITEMIUS

    Tritemius of Herbipolis one day
    While kneeling at the altars foot to pray
    Alone with God as was his pious choice
    Heard from without a miserable voice
    A sound which seemed of all sad things to

    tell
    As of a lost soul crying out of hell

    Thereat the Abbot paused  the chain

    whereby
    His thoughts went upward broken by that

    cry
    And looking from the casement saw below
    A wretched woman witli gray hair aflow
    And withered hands held up to him who

    cried
    For alms as one who might not be denied

    She cried  For the dear love of Him who

    gave
    His life for ours my child from bondage

    save
    My beautiful brave firstborn chained with

    slaves
    In the Moors galley where the sunsmit

    waves
    Lap the white walls of Tunis     What

    I can



    SKIPPER IRESONS RIDE



    55



    I give Triteiuius said my prayers

    O 111 an
    Of God   she cried for grief had made

    her bold
    Mock me not thus  I ask not prayers

    but gold
    Words will not serve me alms alone suffice
    Even while I speak perchance my tirst

    born dies

    Woman   Tritemius answered  from

    our door
    None go unfed hence are we always poor
    A single soldo is our only store
    Thou hast our prayers   what can we

    give thee more

    Give me she said  the silver candle
    sticks

    On either side of the great crucifix

    God well may spare them on His errands
    sped

    Or He can give you golden ones instead

    Then spake Tritemius Even as thy

    word
    Woman so be it  Our most gracious

    Lord
    Who loveth mercy more than sacrifice
    Pardon nie if a human soul I prize
    Above the gifts upon his altar piled
    Take what thou askest and redeem thy

    child

    But his hand trembled as the holy alms
    He placed within the beggars eager palms
    And as she vanished down the linden shade
    He bowed his head and for forgiveness
    prayed

    So the day passed and when the twilight
    came

    He woke to find the chapel all aflame

    And dumb with grateful wonder to be
    hold

    Upon the altar candlesticks of gold



    SKIPPER IRESONS RIDE

    In the valuable and carefully prepared His
    tory of Marblehead published in 1879 by
    Samuel Roads Jr it is stated that the crew
    of Captain Iresou rather than himself were
    responsible for the abandonment of the dis



    abled vessel To screen themselves they
    charged their captain with the crime In view
    of this the writer of the ballad addressed the
    following letter to the historian

    Oak Knoll Danvers 5 mo 18 1880

    My deak Friend  I heartily thank thee
    for a copy of thy History of Marblehead I
    have read it with great interest and think good
    use has been made of the abundant material
    No town in Essex County has a record more
    honorable than Marblehead  no one has done
    more to develop the industrial interests of our
    New England seaboard and certainly none
    have given such evidence of selfsacrificing
    patriotism I am glad the story of it has been
    at last told and told so well I have now no
    doubt that thy version of Skipper Iresons
    ride is the correct one My verse was founded
    solely on a fragment of rhyme which I lieard
    from one of iny early schoolmates a native of
    Marblehead

    I supjjosed the story to which it referred dated
    back at least a century I knew nothing of
    the participators and the narrative of the ballad
    was pure fancy I am glad for the sake of
    truth and justice that the real facts are given in
    thy book I certaiidy would not knowingly do
    injustice to any one dead or living
    I am very truly thy friend

    On Apuleiuss Golden Ass
    Or oneeyed Calendars horse of brass
    Witch astride of a human back
    Islams prophet on AlBorflk
    The strangest ride that ever was sped
    Was Iresons out from INIarblehead
    Old Floyd Ireson for his hard heart
    Tarred and feathered and carried in a
    cart
    By the women of Marblehead

    Body of turkey head of owl
    Wings adroop like a rainedon fowl
    Feathered and ruffled in every part
    Skipper Ireson stood in the cart
    Scores of women old and young
    Strong of muscle and glib of tongue
    Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane
    Shouting and singing the shrill refrain

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Wrinkled scolds with hands on hips

    Girls in bloom of cheek and lips

    Wildeyed freelimbed such as chase

    Bacchus round some antique vase

    Brief of skirt with aukles bare

    Loose of kerchief and loose of hair

    With conchshells blowing and fishhorns

    Over and over the Maenads sang

    Small pity for him   He sailed away
    From a leaking ship in Chaleur Bay
    Sailed away from a sinking wreck
    With his own townspeople on her deck
    Lay by  lay by   they called to him
    Back he answeicd  Sink or swim
    Brag of your catch of fish again
    And off he sailed through the fog and
    rain
    Old Floyd Ireson for his hard heart
    Tarred and feathered and carried in a
    cart
    By the women of Marblehead

    Fathoms deep in dark Chaleur
    That wreck shall lie forevermore
    Mother and sister wife and maid
    Looked from the rocks of Marblehead
    Over the moaning and rainy sea
    Looked for the coming that might not

    be
    What did the winds and the sea  birds

    say
    Of the cruel captain who sailed away
    Old Floyd Ireson for his hard heart
    Tarred and feathered and carried in a
    cart
    By the women of Marblehead

    Through the street on either side
    Up flew windows doors swung wide
    Sharptongued spinsters old wives gray
    Treble lent the fishhorns bray
    Seaworn giandsires cripplebormd
    Hulks of old sailors run aground
    Shook head and fist and hat and cane
    And cracked with curses the hoarse re

    Here s Flud Oirson fur his horrd horrt

    Sweetly along the Salem road
    Bloom of orchard and lilac showed
    Little the wicked skipper knew
    Of the fields so green and the sky so blue
    Riding there in his sorry trim
    Like an Indian idol glum and grim
    Scarcely he seemed the sound to hear
    Of voices sliouting far and near

    Here s Flud Oirson f lu his horrd

    Hear me neighbors   at last he cried
    What to me is this noisy ride
    What is the shame that clothes the skin
    To the nameless horror that lives within
    Waking or sleeping I see a wreck
    And hear a cry from a reeling deck
    Hate me and curse me  I only dread
    The hand of God and the face of the dead
    Said old Floyd Ireson for his hard heart
    Tarred and feathered and carried in a
    cart
    By the women of Marblehead

    Then the wife of the skipper lost at sea
    Said  God has touched him  why should

    we
    Said an old wife mourning her only son
    Cut the rogues tether and let him run
    So with soft relentings and rude excuse
    Half scorn half pity they cut him loose
    And gave him a cloak to hide him in
    And left him alone with his shame and
    sin
    Poor Floyd Ireson for his hard heart
    Tarred and feathered and carried in a
    cart
    By the women of Marblehead



    THE SYCAMORES

    Hugh Tallant was the first Irish resident of
    Haverhill Mass He planted the huttonwood
    trees on the bank of the river below the village
    in the early part of the seventeenth century
    Unfortunately this noble avenue is now nearly
    destroyed

    In the outskirts of the village
    On the rivers winding shores

    Stand the Occidental planetrees
    Stand the ancient sycamores



    THE SYCAMORES



    57



    One long century hath been numbered

    Aiid another lialfway told
    Since the rustic Irish gleeman

    Broke for them the virgin mould

    Deftly set to Celtic music

    At his violins sound they grew

    Tlirongh the moonlit eves of summer
    Making Amphions fable true

    Rise again thou poor Hugh Tallant

    Pass in jerkin green along
    With thy eyes brimful of laughter

    And thy mouth as full of song

    Pioneer of Erins outcasts

    With his fiddle and his pack

    Little dreamed the village Saxons
    Of the myriads at his back

    How he wrought with spade and fiddle
    Delved by day and sang by night

    With a hand that never wearied
    And a heart forever light

    Still the gay tradition mingles
    With a record grave and drear

    Like the rollic air of Cluny

    With the solemn march of Mear

    When the boxtree white with blossoms
    Made tlie sweet May woodlands glad

    And the Aronia by the river
    Lighted up the swarming shad

    And the bulging nets swept shoreward
    With their silversided haul

    Midst the shouts of dripping fishers
    He was merriest of them all

    When among the jovial buskers
    Love stole in at Labors side

    With the lusty airs of England
    Soft his Celtic measures vied

    Songof love and wailing lykewake
    And the merrj fairs carouse

    Of the wild Red Fox of Erin

    And the Woman of Three Cows

    By the blazing hearths of winter
    Pleasant seemed his simple tales

    Midst the grimmer Yorkshire legends
    And the mountain myths of Wales



    How the souls in Purgatory

    Scrambled up from fate forlorn

    On St Kevens sackcloth ladder
    Slyly hitched to Satans horn

    Of the fiddler who at Tara

    Played all night to ghosts of kings
    Of the brown dwarfs and the fairies

    Dancing in their moorland rings

    JoUiest of our birds of singing

    Best he loved the Bobolink
    Hush   he d say  the tipsy fairies

    Hear the little folks in drink

    Merryfaced with spade and fiddle
    Singing through the ancient town

    Only this of poor Hugh Tallant
    Hath Tradition handed down

    Not a stone his grave discloses

    But if yet his spirit walks
    T is beneath the trees he planted

    And when BoboLincoln talks

    Green memorials of the gleeman

    Linking still the rivershores
    With their shadows cast by sunset

    Stand Hugh Tallants sycamores

    Wlien the Father of his Country

    Through the northland riding came

    And the xoofs were starred with baimers
    And the steeples rang acclaim

    When each warscarred Continental
    Leaving smithy mill and farm

    Waved his rusted sword in welcome
    And shot off his old kingsarm

    Slowly passed that august Presence

    Down the thronged and shouting street

    Village girls as white as angels
    Scattering flowers around his feet

    Midway where the planetrees shadow
    Deepest fell his rein he drew

    On his stately head micovered
    Cool and soft the westwind blew

    And he stood up in his stirrups
    Looking up and looking down

    On the hills of Gold and Silver
    Piimming round the little town

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    On the river full of svmshine

    To the lap of greenest vales
    Winding dowai from wooded headlands

    Willowskirted white with sails

    And he said the landscape sweeiiing
    Slowly with his ungloved hand

    I have seen no prospect fairer
    In this goodly Eastern land

    Then the bngles of his escort

    Stirred to life the cavalcade
    And that head so bare and stately

    Vanished down the depths of slaade

    Ever since in town and farmhouse
    Life has had its ebb and flow

    Thrice hath passed the human harvest
    To its garner green and low

    But the trees the gleeman planted

    Through the changes changeless stand

    As the marble calm of Tadmor
    Mocks the deserts shifting sand

    Still the level moon at rising
    Silvers oer each stately shaft

    Still beneath them half in shadow
    Singing glides the pleasure craft

    Still beneath them armenfolded
    Love and Youth together stray

    While as heart to heart beats faster
    More and more their feet delay

    Where the ancient cobbler Keezar

    On the open hillside wrought
    Singing as he drew his stitches

    Songs his German masters taught

    Singing with his gray hair floating
    Round his rosy ample face

    Now a thousand Saxon craftsmen
    Stitch and hammer in his place

    All the pastoral lanes so grassy
    Now are Traffics dusty streets

    From the village grown a city
    Fast the rural grace retreats

    But still green and tall and stately
    On the rivers winding shores

    Stand the Occidental planetrees
    Stand Hugh Tallants sycamores



    THE PIPES AT LUCKNOW
    An incident of the Sepoy mutiny

    Pipes of the misty moorlands

    Voice of the glens and hills
    The droning of the torrents

    The treble of the rills
    Not the braes of bloom and heather

    Nor the mountains dark with rain
    Nor maiden bower nor border tower

    Have heard your sweetest strain

    Dear to the Lowland reaper

    And plaided mountaineer
    To the cottage and the castle

    The Scottish pipes are dear
    Sweet sounds the ancient pibroch

    Oer mountain loch and glade
    But the sweetest of all music

    The pipes at Luckuow played

    Day by day the Indian tiger

    Louder yelled and nearer crept
    Round and round the jungleserpent

    Near and nearer circles swept
    Pray for rescue wives and mothers

    Pray today   the soldier said
    Tomorrow death s between us

    And the wrong and shame we dread

    Oh they listened looked and waited

    Till their hope became despair
    And the sobs of low bewaiUng

    Filled the pauses of their prayer
    Then up spake a Scottish maiden

    With her ear unto the ground
    Dinna ye hear it   dinna ye hear it

    The pipes o Havelock sound

    Hushed the wounded man his groaning

    Hushed the wife her little ones
    Alone they heard the drumroll

    And the roar of Sepoy guns
    But to sounds of home and childhood

    The Highland ear was true
    As her mothers cradlecrooning

    The mountain pipes she knew

    Like the march of soundless music
    Through the vision of the seer

    More of feeling than of hearing
    Of the heart than of the ear

    She knew the droning pibroch



    TELLING THE BEES



    She knew the Campbells call
    Hark  hear ye no MacGregors
    The grandest o them all

    Oh they listened dumb and breathless

    And they caught the sound at last
    Faint and far beyond the Goomtee

    Rose and fell the pipers blast
    Then a burst of wild thanksgiving

    Mingled womans voice and mans
    God be iraised   the maich of Have
    lock

    The piping of the clans

    Louder nearer fierce as vengeance

    Sharp and shrill as swords at strife
    Came the wild MacGregors clancall

    Stinging all the air to life
    But when the faroff dustcloud

    To plaided legions grew
    Full tenderly and blithesomely

    The pipes of rescue blew

    Round the silver domes of Lucknow

    Moslem mosque and Pagan shrine
    Breathed the air to Britons dearest

    The ail of Auld Lang Syne
    Oer the cruel roll of wardrums

    Rose that sweet and homelike strain
    And the tartan clove the turban

    As the Goomtee cleaves the plain

    Dear to the cornland reaper

    And plaided mountaineer
    To the cottage and the castle

    The pipers song is dear
    Sweet soimds the Gaelic pibroch

    Oer mountain glen and glade
    But the sweetest of all music

    The Pipes at Lucknow played

    TELLING THE BEES

    A remarkable custom brought from the Old
    Coimtry formerly prevailed in the rural dis
    tricts of New England On the death of a
    member of the family the bees were at once
    iufomied of the event and their hives dressed
    in mourning This ceremonial was supposed
    to be necessary to prevent the swarms from
    leaving their hives and seeking a new home
    The scene is minutely that of the Whittier
    homestead

    Here Is the place  right over the hill
    Runs the path I took



    You can see the gap in the old wall still
    And the steppiugstoues in the shallow
    brook

    There is the house with the gate red
    barred
    And the poplars tall
    And the barns brown length and the cattle
    yard
    And the white horns tossing above the
    wall

    There are the beehives ranged in the
    sun
    And down by the brink
    Of the brook are her poor flowers weed
    oerrun
    Pansy and daffodil rose and pink

    A year has gone as the tortoise goes

    Heavy and slow
    And the same rose blows and the same
    sun glows

    And the same brook sings of a year



    There s the same sweet cloversmell in the
    breeze

    And the June sun warm
    Tangles his wings of fire in the trees

    Setting as then over Fernside farm

    I mind me how with a lovers care

    From my Sunday coat
    I brushed off the burrs and smoothed my
    hair
    And cooled at the brookside my brow
    and throat

    Since we parted a month had 2assed

    To love a year
    Down through the beeches I looked at last

    On the little red gate and the wellsweep
    near

    I can see it all now  the slantwise rain

    Of light through the leaves
    The sundowns blaze on her windowpane

    The bloom of her roses under the eaves

    Just the same as a month before

    The house and the trees
    The barns brown gable the vine by the
    door

    Nothing changed but the hives of bees

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Before them under the garden wall

    Forward and back
    Went drearily singing the choregirl small

    Draping each hive with a shred of black

    Trembling I listened  the snmmer sun

    Had the chill of snow
    For I knew she was telling the bees of
    one

    Gone on the journey we all must go

    Then I said to myself  My Mary weeps

    For the dead today
    Haply her blind old grandsire sleeps

    The fret and the pain of his age away

    But her dog whined low  on the doorway
    sill

    With his cane to his chin
    Tlie old man sat  and the choregirl still

    Sung to tlie bees stealing out and in

    And the song she was singing ever since

    In my ear sounds on
    Stay at home pretty bees fly not hence

    Mistress Mary is dead and gone



    THE SWAN SONG OF PARSON
    AVERY

    In Youngs Chronicles of Massachusetts Bay
    from 1623 to 1636 may be found Anthony
    Thachers Narrative of his Shiiwreck Tbacher
    was Averys comanion and survived to tell the
    tale Mathers Magnalia III 2 gives further
    Particulars of Parson Averfs End and sug
    gests the title of the poem

    When the reapers task was ended and the

    summer wearing late
    Parson Avery sailed from Newbury with

    his wife and children eight
    Dropping down the riverharbor in the

    shallop  Watch and Wait

    Pleasantly lay the clearings in the mellow

    summermorn
    With the newly planted orchards dropping

    their fruits firstborn
    And the homeroofs like brown islands

    amid a sea of corn

    Broad meadows reached out seaward the
    tided creeks between



    And hills rolled wavelike inland with
    oaks and walnuts green

    A fairer home a goodlier land his eyes
    had never seen

    Yet away sailed Parson Avery away where

    duty led
    And the voice of God seemed calling to

    break the living bread
    To the souls of fishers starving on tlie

    rocks of Marblehead

    All day they sailed  at nightfall the
    pleasant landbreeze died

    The blackening sky at midnight its starry
    lights denied

    And far and low the thunder of tempest
    prophesied

    Blotted out were all the coast  lines

    gone were rock and wood and

    sand
    Grimly anxious stood tlie skipper with the

    rudder in his hand
    And questioned of the darkness what was

    sea and what was land

    And the preacher heard his dear ones
    nestled round him weeping sore

    Never heed my little children  Christ
    is walking on before

    To the pleasant land of heaven where the
    sea shall be no more

    All at once the great cloud parted like a

    curtain drawn aside
    To let down the torch of lightning on the

    terror far and Avide
    And the thunder and the whirlwind together

    smote the tide

    There was wailing in the shallop womans

    wail and mans despair
    A crash of breaking timbers on the rocks

    so sharp and bare
    And through it all the murmur of Father

    Averys prayer

    From his struggle in the darkness with the

    wild waves and the blast
    On a rock where every billow broke above

    him as it passed
    Alone of all his household the man of

    God was cast



    THE DOUBLEHEADED SNAKE OF NEWBURY



    6i



    There a comrade heard him praying in the

    pause of wave and wind
    All my own have gone before me and I

    linger just behind
    Not for life I ask but only for the rest Thy

    ransomed iind

    In this night of death I challenge the

    promise of Thy word
    Let me see the great salvation of which

    mine ears have heard
    Let me pass from hence forgiven through

    the grace of Christ our Lord

    Li the baptism of these waters wash
    white my every sin

    And let me follow uj to Thee my house
    hold and my kin

    Open the seagate of Thy heaven and let
    me enter in

    When the Christian sings his deathsong
    all the listening heavens draw near

    And the angels leaning over the walls of
    crystal hear

    How the notes so faint and broken swell to
    music in Gods ear

    The ear of God was open to His servants

    last request
    As the strong wave swept him downward

    the sweet hymn upward pressed
    And the soul of Father Avery went singing

    to its rest

    There was wailing on the mainland from

    the rocks of Marblehead
    In the stricken church of Newbury the notes

    of prayer were read
    And long by board and hearthstone the

    living mourned the dead

    And still the fishers oiitbound or scudding

    from the squall
    With grave and reverent faces the ancient

    tale recall
    When they see the white waves breaking

    on the Rock of Averys Fall

    THE DOUBLEHEADED SNAKE
    OF NEWBURY

    Concerning y Amphishsena as soon as I
    received your commands I made diligent in
    quiry   he assures me y it had really two



    heads one at each end  two mouths two stings
    or tongues  Rev Chbistopher Toppan to
    Cotton Mather

    Far away in the twilight time
    Of every people in every clime
    Dragons and griffins and monsters dire
    Born of water and air and fire
    Or nursed like the Python in the mud
    And ooze of the old Deucalion flood
    Crawl and wriggle and foam with rage
    Through dusk tradition and ballad age
    So from the childhood of Newbury town
    And its time of fable the tale comes down
    Of a terror which haunted bush and brake
    The Amphisbsena the Double Snake

    Thou who makest the tale thy mirth

    Consider that strip of Christian earth

    On the desolate shore of a sailless sea

    Full of terror and mystery

    Half redeemed from the evil hold

    Of the wood so dreary and dark and old

    Which drank with its lips of leaves the dew

    When Time was young and the world was

    new
    And wove its shadows with sun and moon
    Ere the stones of Cheops were squared and

    hewn
    Think of the seas dread monotone
    Of the mournful wail from the pinewood

    blown
    Of the strange vast splendors that lit the

    North
    Of the troubled throes of the quaking earth
    And the dismal tales the Indian told
    Till the settlers heart at his hearth grew

    cold
    And he shrank from the tawny wizard

    boasts
    And the hovering shadows seemed full of

    ghosts
    And above below and on every side
    The fear of his creed seemed verified
    And think if his lot were now thine own
    To grope with terrors nor named nor known
    How laxer muscle and weaker nerve
    And a feebler faith thy need might serve
    And owni to thyself the wonder more
    That the snake had two heads and not a

    score

    Wliether he lurked in the Oldtown fen
    Or the gray earthflax of the Devils Den
    Or swam in the wooded Artichoke

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Or coiled by the Northmans Written Rock
    Nothing on record is left to show
    Only the fact that he lived we know
    And left the cast of a double head
    In the scaly mask which he yearly shed
    For he carried a head where his tail should

    be
    And the two of course could never agree
    But wriggled about with main and might
    Now to the left and now to the right
    Pulling and twisting this way and that
    Neither knew what the other was at

    A snake with two heads lurking so near
    Judge of the wonder guess at the fear
    Think what ancient gossips might say
    Shaking their heads in their dreary way
    Between the meetings on Sabbathday
    How urchins searching at days decline
    The Common Pasture for sheep or kine
    The terrible doubleganger heard
    In leafy rustle or whir of bird
    Think what a zest it gave to the sport
    In berrytime of tlie younger sort
    As over pastures blackberrytwined
    Reuben and Dorothy lagged behind
    And closer and closer for fear of harm
    The maiden clung to her lovers arm
    And how the spark who was forced to stay
    By his sweethearts fears till the break of

    day
    Thanked the snake for the fond delay

    Far and wide the tale was told

    Like a snowball growing while it rolled

    The nurse hushed with it the babys cry

    And it served in the worthy ministers eye

    To paint the primitive serpent by

    Cotton Mather came galloping down

    All the way to Newbury town

    With his eyes agog and his ears set wide

    And his marvellous inkhorn at his side

    Stirring the while in the shallow pool

    Of his brains for the lore he learned at

    school
    To garnish the story with here a streak
    Of Latin and there another of Greek
    And the tales he heard and the notes he

    took
    Behold  are they not in his WonderBook

    Stories like dragons are hard to kill
    If the snake does not the tale runs still
    In Byfield Meadows on Pipestave Hill
    And still whenever luisband and wife



    Publish the shame of their daily strife
    And with mad crosspurpose tug and strain
    At either end of the marriagechain
    The gossips say with a knowing shake
    Of their gray heads  Look at the Double

    Snake
    One in body and two in will
    The Amphisbsena is living still

    A HARVEST IDYL

    Susanna Martin an aged woman of Ames
    bury Mass was tried and executed for the
    alleged crime of witchcraft Her home was in
    what is now known as Pleasant Valley on the
    Merrimac a little above the old Ferry way
    where tradition says an attempt was mside to
    assassinate Sir Edmund Andres on his way
    to Falmouth afterward Portland and Pema
    quid which was frustrated by a warning timely
    given Goody Martin was the only woman
    hanged on the north side of the Merrimac
    during the dreadful delusion The aged wife
    of Judge Bradburj who lived on the other side
    of the Powow River was imprisoned and would
    have been put to death but for the collapse of
    the hideous persecution

    The substance of the poem which follows
    was published under the name of The Witch s
    Daughter in The National Era in 1857 In
    1875 my publishers desired to issue it with illus
    trations and I then enlarged it and otherwise
    altered it to its present form The principal
    addition was in the verses which constitute
    Part I



    I CALL the old time back  I bring my

    lay
    In tender memory of the summer day
    When where our native river lapsed away

    We dreamed it over while the thrushes

    made
    Songs of their own and the great pinetrees

    laid
    On warm noonlights the masses of their

    shade

    And she was with us living oer again
    Her life in ours despite of years and

    pain
    The Autumns brightness after latter rain



    MABEL MARTIN



    63



    Beautiful in her holy peace as one

    Who stands at evening when the work is

    done
    Glorified in the setting of the sun

    Her memory makes our common landscape

    seem
    Fairer than any of which painters dream
    Lights the brown hills and sings in every

    stream

    For she whose speech was always truths

    pure gold
    Heard not unpleased its simple legends

    told
    And loved with us the beautiful and old

    I THE RIVER VALLEY

    Across the level tableland
    A grassy rarely trodden way
    With thinnest skirt of birchen spray

    And stunted growth of cedar leads
    To where you see the dull plain fall
    Sheer off steepslanted ploughed by all

    The seasons rainfalls On its brink
    The overleaning harebells swing
    With roots half bare the pinetrees cling

    And through the shadow looking west
    You see the wavering river flow
    Along a vale that far below

    Holds to the siui the sheltering hills
    And glimmering waterline between
    Broad fields of corn and meadows green

    And fruitbent orchards grouped around
    The low brown roofs and painted eaves
    And chimneytops half hid in leaves

    No warmer valley hides behind

    Yon windscourged sanddunes cold and

    bleak
    No fairer river comes to seek

    The wavesung welcome of the sea
    Or mark the northmost border line
    Of sunloved growths of nut and vine

    Here groundfast in their native fields
    Untempted by the citys gain
    The quiet farmer folk remain



    Who bear the pleasant name of Friends
    And keep their fathers gentle ways
    And simple speech of Bible days

    In whose neat homesteads woman holds
    With modest ease her equal place
    And wears upon her tranquil face

    The look of one who merging not
    Her selfhood in anothers will
    Is loves and dutys handmaid still

    Pass with me down the path that winds
    Through birches to the open land
    Where close upon the river strand

    You mark a cellar vine oerrun

    Above whose wall of loosened stones
    The sumach lifts its reddening cones

    And the black nightshades berries shine
    And broad unsightly burdocks fold
    The household ruin centuryold

    Here in the dim colonial time

    Of sterner lives and gloomier faith
    A woman lived tradition saith

    Who wrought her neighbors foul annoy
    And witched and plagued the country
    side
    Till at the hangmans hand she died

    Sit with me while the westering day
    Falls slantwise down the quiet vale
    And haply ere yon loitering sail

    That rounds the upper headland falls
    Below Deer Islands pines or sees
    Behind it Hawkswoods belt of trees

    Rise black against the sinking sun
    My idyl of its days of old
    The valleys legend shall be told

    II THE HUSKING

    It was the pleasant harvesttime
    When cellarbins are closely stowed
    And garrets bend beneath their load

    And the old swallowhaunted barns
    Browngabled long and full of seams
    Through which the moted sunlight
    streams

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And winds blow freshly in to shake
    The red plumes of the roosted cocks
    And the loose hay  mows scented
    locks

    Are filled with summers ripened stores
    Its odorous grass and barley sheaves
    From their low scaffolds to their eaves

    On Esek Hardens oaken floor

    With many an autumn threshing worn
    Lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn

    And thither came young men and maids
    Beneath a moon that large and low
    Lit that sweet eve of long ago

    They took their places  some by chance
    And others by a merry voice
    Or sweet smile guided to their choice

    How pleasantly the rising moon
    Between the shadow of the mows
    Looked on them through the great elm
    boughs

    On sturdy boyhood sunembrowned
    On girlhood with its solid cuives
    Of healthful strength and painless nerves

    And jests went round and laughs that
    made
    The housedog answer with his howl
    And kept astir the barnyard fowl

    And quaint old songs their fathers sung
    In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors
    Ere Norman William trod their shores

    And tales whose merry license shook
    The fat sides of the Saxon thane
    Forgetful of the hovering Dane



    Rude plays to Celt and Cimbri known
    The charms and riddles that beguiled
    On Oxus banks the young worlds
    child



    That primal picturespeech wherein
    Have youth and maid the story told
    So new in each so dateless old

    Recalling pastoral Ruth in her

    Who waited blushing and demure
    The redears kiss of forfeiture



    III THE witchs daughter

    But still the sweetest voice was mute
    That rivervalley ever heard
    From lips of maid or throat of bird

    For Mabel Martiii sat apart

    And let the haymows shadow fall
    Upon the loveliest face of all

    She sat apart as one forbid

    Who knew that none would condescend
    To own the Witchwifes child a friend

    The seasons scarce had gone their round
    Since curious thousands thronged to see
    Her mother at the gallowstree

    And mocked the prisonpalsied limbs
    That faltered on the fatal staiiS
    And wan lip trembling with its prayers

    Few questioned of the sorrowing child
    Or when they saw the mother die
    Dreamed of the daughters agony

    They went up to their homes that day
    As men and Christians justified
    God willed it and the wretch had died

    Dear God and Father of us all
    Forgive our faith in cruel lies
    Forgive the blindness that denies

    Forgive thy creature when he takes
    For the allperfect love Thou art
    Some grim creation of his heart

    Cast down our idols overturn
    Our bloody altars  let us see
    Thyself in Thy humanity

    Young Mabel from her mothers grave
    Crept to her desolate hearthstone
    And wrestled with her fate alone

    With love and anger and despair
    The phantoms of disordered sense
    The awful doubts of Providence

    Oh dreary broke the winter days
    And dreary fell the winter nights
    When one by one the neighboring
    liirhts



    MABEL MARTIN



    65



    Went out and human sounds grew still
    And all the phantompeopled dark
    Closed round her hearthfires dying
    spark

    And summer days were sad and long
    And sad the uucoinpanioned eves
    And sadder sunsettinted leaves

    And Indian Summers airs of balm
    She scarcely felt the soft caress
    The beauty died of loneliness

    The schoolboys jeered her as they passed
    And when she sought the house of prayer
    Her mothers curse pursued her there

    And still oer many a neighboring door
    She saw the horseshoes curved charm
    To guard against her mothers harm

    That mother poor and sick and lame
    Who dail3 by the old armcliair
    Folded her withered hands in prayer

    Who turned in Salems dreary jail
    Her worn old Bible oer and oer
    When her dim eyes could read no more

    Sore tried and pained the poor girl kept
    Her faith and trusted that her way
    So dark would somewhere meet the day

    And still her weary wheel went round
    Day after day with no relief
    Small leisure have the poor for grief



    IV THE CHAMPION

    So in the shadow Mabel sits

    Untouched by mirth she sees and hears
    Her smile is sadder than her tears

    But cruel eyes have found her out
    And cruel lips repeat her name
    And taunt her with her mothers shame

    She answered not with railing words
    But drew her apron oer her face
    And sobbing glided from the place

    And only pausing at the door

    Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze
    Of one who in her better days



    Had been her warm and steady friend
    Ere yet her mothers doom had made
    Even Esek Harden half afraid

    He felt that mute appeal of tears
    And starting with an angry frown
    Hushed all the wicked murmurs down

    Good neighbors mine he sternly said
    This passes harmless mirth or jest
    I brook no insult to my guest

    She is indeed her mothers child
    But Gods sweet pity ministers
    Unto no whiter soul than hers

    Let Goody Martin rest in peace
    I never knew her harm a tly
    And witch or not God knows  not I

    I know who swore her life away
    And as God lives I d not condemn
    An Indian dog on word of them

    The broadest lands in all the town
    The skill to guide the power to awe
    Were Hardens  and his word was law

    None dared withstand him to his face
    But one sly maiden spake aside
    The little witch is evileyed

    Her mother only killed a cow
    Or witched a churn or dairypan
    But she forsooth must charm a man



    V IN THE SHADOW

    Poor Mabel homeward turning passed
    The nameless terrors of the wood
    And saw as if a ghost pursued

    Her shadow gliding in the moon

    The soft breath of the westwind gave
    A chill as from her mothers grave

    How dreary seemed the silent house
    Wide in the moonbeams ghastly glare
    Its windows had a dead mans stare

    And like a gaunt and spectral hand
    The tremulous shadow of a birch
    Reached out and touched the doors low
    poich

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    As if to lift its latch  hard by
    A siidclen warning call she laeard
    The nightcry of a boding bird

    She leaned against the door  her face
    So fair so young so full of pain
    White in the moonlights silver rain

    The river on its pebbled rim

    Made music such as childhood knew
    The dooryard tree was whispered
    through

    By voices such as childhoods ear
    Had heard in moonlights long ago
    And through the willowboughs below

    She saw the rippled waters shine
    Beyond in waves of shade and light
    The hills rolled oft into the night

    She saw and heard but over all

    A sense of some transforming spell
    The shadow of her sick heart fell

    And still across the wooded space
    The harvest lights of Harden shone
    And song and jest and laugh went



    And he so gentle true and strong
    Of men the bravest and the best
    Had he too scorned her with
    rest



    the



    She strove to drown her sense of wrong
    And in her old and simple way
    To teach her bitter heart to pray

    Poor child  the prayer begun in faith
    Grew to a low despairing cry
    Of utter misery   Let me die

    Oh  take me from the scornful eyes
    And hide me where the cruel speech
    And mocking finger may not reach

    I dare not breathe my mothers name
    A daughters right I dare not crave
    To weep above her unblest grave

    Let me not live until my heart
    With few to pity and with none
    To love me hardens into stone



    O God  have mercy on Thy child

    Whose faith in Thee grows weak and

    small
    And take me ere I lose it all

    A shadow on the moonlight fell

    And murmuring wind and wave became
    A voice whose burden was her name



    VI THE BETROTHAL



    Had



    then God heard her  Had He
    sent
    His angel down  In flesh and blood
    Before her Esek Harden stood

    He laid his hand upon her arm

    Dear Mabel this no more shall be
    Who scoffs at you must scoff at me

    You know rough Esek Harden well
    And if he seems no suitor gay
    And if his hair is touched with gray

    The maiden grown shall never find

    His heart less warm than when she

    smiled
    Upon his knees a little child

    Her tears of grief were tears of joy
    As folded in his strong embrace
    She looked in Esek Hardens face

    O truest friend of all   she said

    God bless you for your kindly thought
    And make me worthy of my lot

    He led her forth and blent in one
    Beside their happy pathway ran
    The shadows of the maid and man

    He led her through his dewy fields

    To where the swinging lanterns glowed
    And through the doors the buskers
    showed

    Good friends and neighbors   Esek said
    I m weary of this lonely life
    In Mabel see my chosen wife

    She greets you kindly one and all
    The past is past and all offence
    Falls harmless from her innocence



    THE PROPHECY OF SAMUEL SEWALL



    67



    Henceforth she stands no more alone
    You know what Esek Harden is
    He brooks no wrong to him or his

    Now let the merriest tales be told
    And let the sweetest songs be sung
    That ever made the old heart young

    For now the lost has found a home
    And a lone hearth shall brighter burn
    As all the household joys return

    Oh pleasantly the harvestmoon
    Between the shadow of the mows
    Looked on them through the great elm
    boughs

    On Mabels cixrls of golden hair
    On Eseks shaggy strength it fell
    And the wind whispered  It is well



    THE PROPHECY OF SAMUEL
    SEWALL

    The prose version of this prophecy is to be
    found in Sewalls The New Heaven upon the
    New Earth 1C97 quoted in Joshua Coffins
    History of Newhury Judge Sewalls father
    Henry Sewall was one of the pioneers of New
    bury

    Up and down the village streets
    Strange are the forms my fancy meets
    For the thoughts and things of today are

    hid
    And through the veil of a closed lid
    The ancient worthies I see again
    I hear the tap of the elders cane
    And his awful periwig I see
    And the silver buckles of shoe and knee
    Stately and slow with thoughtful air
    His black cap hiding his whitened hair
    Walks the Judge of the great Assize
    Samuel Sewall the good and wise
    His face with lines of firmness wrought
    He wears the look of a man unbought
    Who swears to his hurt and changes not
    Yet touched and softened nevertheless
    With the grace of Christian gentleness
    The face that a child would climb to kiss
    True and tender and brave and just
    That man might honor and woman trust

    Touching and sad a tale is told
    Like a penitent hymn of the Psalmist old



    Of the fast which the good man lifelong

    kept
    With a haunting sorrow that never slept
    As the circling year brought round the time
    Of an error that left the sting of crime
    When he sat on the bench of the witchcraft

    courts
    With the laws of Moses and Hales Reports
    And spake in the name of both the word
    That gave the witchs neck to the cord
    And piled the oaken planks that pressed
    The feeble life from the warlocks breast
    All the day long from dawn to dawn
    His door was bolted his curtain drawn
    No foot on his silent threshold trod
    No eye looked on him save that of God
    As he baffled the ghosts of the dead with

    charms
    Of penitent tears and prayers and psalms
    And with precious proofs from the sacred

    word
    Of the boundless pity and love of the Lord
    His faith confirmed and his trust renewed
    That the sin of his ignorance sorely rued
    Might be washed away in the mingled flood
    Of his human sorrow and Christs dear

    blood

    Green forever the memory be
    Of the Judge of the old Theocracy
    Whom even his errors glorified
    Like a farseen sunlit mountainside
    By the cloudy shadows which oer it glide
    Honor and praise to the Puritan
    Who the halting step of his age outran
    And seeing the infinite worth of man
    In the priceless gift the Father gave
    In the infinite love that stooped to save
    Dared not brand his brother a slave
    Who doth such wrong he was wont to

    say
    In his own quaint pictureloving way
    Flings up to Heaven a handgrenade
    Which God shall cast down upon his head

    Widely as heaven and hell contrast
    That brave old jurist of the past
    And the cunning trickster and knave of

    courts
    Who the holy features of Truth distorts
    Ruling as right the will of the strong
    Poverty crime and weakness wrong
    Wideeared to power to the wronged and

    weak
    Deaf as Egypts gods of leek

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Scoffing aside at partys nod

    Order of nature and law of God

    For whose dabbled ermine respect were

    waste
    Reverence folly and awe misplaced
    Justice of Avhom t were vain to seek
    As from Koordish robber or Syrian Sheik
    Oh leave the wretch to his bribes and sins
    Let him rot in the web of lies he spins
    To the saintly soul of the early day
    To the Christian judge let us turn and

    say
    Praise and thanks for an honest man
    Glory to God for the Puritan

    I see far southward this quiet day
    The hills of Newbury rolling away
    With the many tints of the season gay
    Dreamily blending in autumn mist
    Crimson and gold and amethyst
    Long and low with dwarf trees crowned
    Plum Island lies like a whale aground
    A stones toss over the narrow sound
    Inland as far as the eye can go
    The hills curve round like a bended bow
    A silver arrow from out them sprung
    I see the shine of the Quasycung
    And round and romid over valley and

    hill
    Old roads winding as old roads will
    Here to a ferry and there to a mill
    And glimpses of chimneys and gabled

    eaves
    Through green elm arches and maple

    leaves
    Old homesteads sacred to all that can
    Gladden or sadden the heart of man
    Over whose thresholds of oak and stone
    Life and Death have come and gone
    There pictured tiles in the fireplace show
    Great beams sag from the ceiling low
    The dresser glitters with polished wares
    The long clock ticks on the footworn stairs
    And the low broad chimney shows the

    crack
    By the earthquake made a century back
    Up from their midst springs the village

    spire
    With the crest of its cock in the sun afire
    Beyond are orchards and planting lands
    And great salt marshes and glimmering

    sands
    And where north and south the coastlines

    run
    The blink of the sea in breeze and sun



    I see it all like a chart unrolled
    But my thoughts are full of the past and

    old
    I hear the tales of my boyhood told
    And the shadows and shapes of early days
    Flit dimly by in the veiling haze
    With measured movement and rhythmic

    chime
    Weaving like shuttles my web of rhyme
    I think of the old man wise and good
    Who once on yon misty hillsides stood
    A poet who never measured rhyme
    A seer unknown to his dulleared time
    And propped on his staff of age looked

    down
    With his boyhoods love on his native town
    Where written as if on its hills and plains
    His burden of prophecy yet remains
    For the voices of wood and wave and wind
    To read in the ear of the musing mind

    As long as Plum Island to guard the
    coast
    As God appointed shall keep its post
    As long as a salmon shall havmt the deep
    Of Merrimac River or stvirgeon leap
    As long as pickerel swift and slim
    Or redbacked perch in Crane Pond swim
    As long as the annual seafowl know
    Their time to come and their time to go
    As long as cattle shall roam at will
    The green grass meadows by Turkey Hill
    As long as sheep shall look from the side
    Of Oldtown Hill on marishes wide
    And Parker River and saltsea tide
    As long as a wandering pigeon shall search
    The fields below from his whiteoak perch
    When the barleyharvest is ripe and shorn
    And the dry husks fall from the standing

    corn
    As long as Nature shall not grow old
    Nor drop her work from her doting hold
    And her care for the Indian corn forget
    And the yellow rows in pairs to set
    So long shall Christians here be born
    Grow up and ripen as Gods sweet corn
    By the beak of bird  by the breath of frost
    Shall never a holy ear be lost
    But husked by Death in the Planters

    sight
    Be sown again in the fields of light

    The Island still is purple with plums

    Up the river the salmon comes

    The sturgeon leaps and the wildfowl feeds

    On hillside berries and marish seeds
    All the beautiful signs remain
    From springtime sowing to autumn rain
    The good mans vision returns again
    And let us hope as well we can
    That the Silent Angel who garners man
    May find some grain as of old he found
    In the human cornfield ripe and sound
    And the Lord of the Harvest deign

    own
    The precious seed by the fathers sown

    THE RED RIVER VOYAGEUR

    Suggested by reading the following passage
    in Minnesota and its Resources by J Wesley
    Bond   As I pass slowly along the lonely
    road that leads me fropi thee Selkirk mine
    eyes do turn continually to gaze upon thy smil
    ing golden fields and thy lofty towers now
    burnished with the rays of the departing sun
    while the sweet vesper bell reverberates afar
    and strikes so mounifuUy pleasant upon mine
    ear I feel satisfied that though absent thou
    sands of weary miles my thoughts will always
    dwell on thee with rapturous emotions At
    midnight with the last stroke of the clock
    ushering in the 17th of December 1811 the
    S4tli anniversary of Whittiers birth the bells
    of St Boniface rang a joyous peal

    Out and in the river is winding
    The links of its long red chain

    Through belts of dusky pineland
    And gusty leagues of plain

    Only at times a smokewreath

    With the drifting cloudrack joins

    The smoke of the huntinglodges
    Of the wild Assiniboins

    Drearily blows the northwind
    From the land of ice and snow

    The eyes that look are weary
    And heavy the hands that row

    And with one foot on the water

    And one upon the shore
    The Angel of Shadow gives warning

    That day shall be no more

    Is it the clang of wildgeese

    Is it the Indians yell
    That lends to the voice of the northwind

    The tones of a faroff bell



    The voyageur smiles as he listens
    To the somul that grows apace

    Well he knows the vesper ringing
    Of the bells of St Boniface

    The bells of the Roman Mission
    That call from their turrets twain

    To the boatman on the river
    To the hmiter on the plain

    Even so in our mortal journey
    The bitter northAvinds blow

    And thus upon lifes Red River
    Our hearts as oarsmen row

    And when the Angel of Shadow
    Rests bis feet on wave and shore

    And our eyes grow dim with watching
    And our hearts faint at the oar

    Happy is he who heareth

    The signal of his release
    In the bells of the Holy City

    The chimes of eternal peace



    THE PREACHER

    George Whitefield the celebrated preacher
    died at Newbiiryport in 1770 and was buried
    under the church which has since borne his



    Its windows flashing to the sky
    Beneath a thousand roofs of brown
    Far down the vale my friend and I
    Beheld the old and quiet town
    The ghostly sails that out at sea
    Flapped their white wings of mystery
    The beaches glimmering in the sun
    And the low wooded capes that run
    Into the seamist north and south
    The sandbluffs at the rivers mouth
    The swinging chainbridge and afar
    The foamline of the harborbar

    Over the woods and meadowlands

    A crimsontinted shadow lay

    Of clouds through which the setting day

    Flung a slant glory far away

    It glittered on the wet seasands

    It flamed upon the citys panes

    Smote the white sails of ships that wore

    Outward or in and glided oer

    The steeples with their veering vanes

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Awhile my friend with rapid search
    Oerran the laudsca3e  Yonder spire
    Over gray roofs a shaft of fire
    What is it pray     The Whitefield

    Church
    Walled about by its basement stones
    There rest the marvellous prophets bones
    Then as our homeward way we walked
    Of the great preachers life we talked
    And through the mystery of our theme
    The outward glory seemed to stream
    And Natures self interpreted
    The doubtful record of the dead
    And every level beam that smote
    The sails upon the dark afloat
    A symbol of the light became
    Which touched the shadows of our blame
    With tongues of Pentecostal flame

    Over the roofs of the pioneers
    Gathers the moss of a hundied years
    On man and his works has passed the

    change
    Which needs must be in a centurys range
    The land lies open and warm in the sun
    Anvils clamor and millwheels run
    Flocks on the hillsides herds on the plain
    The wilderness gladdened with fruit and

    grain
    But the living faith of the settlers old
    A dead profession their children hold
    To the lust of office and greed of trade
    A steppingstone is the altar made
    The Church to place and power the door
    Rebukes the sin of the world no more
    Nor sees its Lord in the homeless poor
    Everywhere is the grasping hand
    And eager adding of land to land
    And earth which seemed to the fathers

    meant
    But as a pilgrims wayside tent
    A nightly shelter to fold away
    When the Lord should call at the break of

    day
    Solid and steadfast seems to be
    And Time has forgotten Eternity

    But fresh and green from the rotting roots
    Of primal forests the young growth shoots
    From the death of the old the new proceeds
    And the life of truth from the rot of creeds
    On the ladder of God which upward leads
    The steps of progress are human needs
    For His judgments still are a mighty deep
    And the eyes of His providence never sleep



    When the night is darkest He gives the

    morn
    When the famine is sorest the wine and

    corn

    In the church of the wilderness Edwards

    wrought
    Shaping his creed at the forge of thought
    And with Thors own hammer welded and

    bent
    The iron links of his argument
    Which strove to grasp in its mighty span
    The purpose of God and the fate of man
    Yet faithful still in his daily round
    To the weak and the poor and sinsick

    found
    The schoolmans lore and the casuists art
    Drew warmth and life from his fervent

    heart
    Had he not seen in the solitudes
    Of his deep and dark Northampton woods
    A vision of love about him fall
    Not the blinding splendor which fell on

    Saul
    But the tenderer glory that rests on them
    Who walk in the New Jerusalem
    Where never the sun nor moon are known
    But the Lord and His love are the light

    alone
    And watching the sweet still countenance
    Of the wife of his bosom rapt in trance
    Had he not treasured each broken word
    Of the mystical wonder seen and heard
    And loved the beautiful dreamer more
    That thus to the desert of earth she bore
    Clusters of Eshcol from Canaans shore

    As the barley winnower holding with pain
    Aloft in waiting his chaff and grain
    Joyfully welcomes the farofp breeze
    Sounding the pinetrees slender keys
    So he who had waited long to hear
    The sound of the Spirit drawing near
    Like that which the son of Iddo heard
    When the feet of angels the juyrtles

    stirred
    Felt the answer of prayer at last
    As over his church the afflatus passed
    Breaking its sleep as breezes break
    To sunbright ripples a stagnant lake

    At first a tremor of silent fear
    The creep of the flesh at danger near
    A vague foreboding and discontent
    Over the hearts of the people went



    THE PREACHER



    71



    All nature warned in sounds and signs
    The wind in the tops of the forest pines
    In the name of tlie Highest called to jirayer
    As the muezzin calls from the minaret stair
    Through ceiled chambers of secret sin
    Sudden and strong the light shone in
    A guilty sense of his neighbors needs
    Startled the man of titledeeds
    The trembling hand of the worldling shook
    The dust of years from the Holy Book
    And the psalms of David forgotten long
    Took the place of the scoffers song

    The impulse spread like the outward course
    Of waters moved by a central force
    The tide of spiritual life rolled down
    From inland mountains to seaboard town

    Prepared and ready the altar stands
    Waiting the prophets outstretched hands
    And prayer availing to downward call
    The fiery answer in view of all
    Hearts are like wax in the furnace  who
    Shall mould and shape and cast them

    anew
    Lo  by the Merrimac Whitefleld stands
    In the temple that never was made by

    hands
    Curtains of azure and crystal wall
    And dome of the sunshine over all
    A homeless pilgrim with dubious name
    Blown about on the winds of fame
    Now as an angel of blessing classed
    And now as a mad enthusiast
    Called in his youth to sound and gauge
    The moral lapse of his race and age
    And sharp as truth the contrast draw
    Of human frailty and perfect law
    Possessed by the one dread thought that

    lent
    Its goad to his fiery temperament
    Up and down the world he went
    A John the Baptist crying Repent

    No perfect whole can our nature make
    Here or there the circle will break
    The orb of life as it takes the light
    On one side leaves the other in night
    Never was saint so good and great
    As to give no chance at St Peters gate
    For the plea of the Devils advocate
    So incomplete by his beings law
    The marvellous preacher had his flaw
    With step unequal and lame with faults
    His shade on the jiath of History halts



    Wisely and well said the Eastern bard
    Fear is easy but love is hard
    Easy to glow with the Santons rage
    And walk on the Meccan pilgrimage
    But he is greatest and best who can
    Worship Allah by loving man

    Thus he  to whom in the painful stress
    Of zeal on fire from its own excess
    Heaven seemed so vast and earth so small
    That man was nothing since God was all
    Forgot as the best at times have done
    That the love of the Lord and of man are one

    Little to him whose feet unshod
    The thorny path of the desert trod
    Careless of pain so it led to God
    Seemed the hungerpang and the poor mans

    wrong
    The weak ones trodden beneath the strong
    Should the worm be chooser   the clay

    withstand
    The shaping will of the potters hand

    In the Indian fable Arjoon hears
    The scorn of a god rebuke his fears
    Spare thy pity   Krishna saith
    Not in thy sword is the power of death
    All is illusion  loss but seems
    Pleasiue and pain are only dreams
    Who deems he slayeth doth not kill
    Who counts as slain is living still
    Strike nor fear thy blow is crime
    Nothing dies but the cheats of time
    Slain or slayer small the odds
    To each immortal as Indras gods

    So by Savannahs banks of shade
    The stones of his mission the preacher laid
    On the heart of the negro crushed and rent
    And made of his blood the walls cement
    Bade the slaveship speed from coast to

    coast
    Fanned by the wings of the Holy Ghost
    And begged for the love of Christ the gold
    Coined from the hearts in its groaning hold
    What could it matter more or less
    Of stripes and hunger and weariness
    Living or dying bond or free
    What was time to eternity

    Alas for the preachers cherished schemes
    Mission and church are now but dreams
    Nor prayer nor fasting availed the plan
    To honor God throujrh the wrons of man

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Of all his labors no trace remains

    Save the bondman lifting his hands in

    chains
    The woof he wove in the righteous warp
    Of freedomloving Oglethorpe
    Clothes with curses the goodly land
    Changes its greenness and bloom to sand
    And a centurys lapse reveals once more
    The slaveship stealing to Georgias shore
    Father of Light  how blind is he
    Who sprinkles the altar he rears to Thee
    With the blood and tears of humanity

    He erred  shall we count His gifts as

    naught
    Was the work of God in him unwrought
    The servant may through his deafness err
    And blind may be Gods messenger
    But the errand is sure they go upon
    The word is spoken the deed is done
    Was the Hebrew temple less fair and good
    That Solomon bowed to gods of wood
    For his tempted heart and wandering feet
    Were the songs of David less pure and

    sweet
    So in light and shadow the preacher went
    Gods erring and human instrument
    And the hearts of the people where he

    jjassed
    Swayed as the reeds sway in the blast
    Under the spell of a voice which took
    In its compass the flow of Siloas brook
    And the mystical chime of the bells of gold
    On the ephods hem of the priest of old
    Now the roll of thunder and now the awe
    Of the trumpet heard in the Mount of Law

    A solemn fear on the listening crowd
    Fell like the shadow of a cloud
    The sailor reeling from out the ships
    Whose masts stood thick in the riverslips
    Felt the jest and the curse die on his lips
    Listened the fisherman rude and hard
    The calker rough from the builders yard
    The man of the market left his load
    The teamster leaned on his bending goad
    The maiden and youth beside her felt
    Their hearts in a closer union melt
    And saw the flowers of their love in bloom
    Down tlie endless vistas of life to come
    Old age sat feelily brushing away
    From his ears the scanty locks of gray
    And careless boyhood living the free
    Unconscious life of bird and tree
    Suddenly wakened to a sense



    Of sin and its guilty consequence
    It was as if an angels voice
    Called the listeners up for their final choice
    As if a strong hand rent apart
    The veils of sense from soul and heart
    Showing in light ineffable
    The joys of heaven and woes of hell
    All about in the misty aii
    The hills seemed kneeling in silent prajer
    The rustle of leaves the moaning sedge
    The waters lap on its gravelled edge
    The wailing pines and far and faint
    The wooddoves note of sad complaint
    To the solemn voice of the preacher lent
    An undertone as of low lament
    And the rote of the sea from its sandy coast
    On the easterly wmd now heard now lost
    Seemed the murmurous soimd of the judg
    ment host

    Yet wise men doubted and good men wept
    As that storm of passion above them swept
    And cometlike adding flame to flame
    The priests of the new Evangel came
    Davenport flasliing vqjon the ciowd
    Charged like summers electric cloud
    Now holding the listener still as death
    With terrible warnings under breath
    Now shouting for joy as if he viewed
    The vision of Heavens beatitude
    And Celtic Tennant his long coat bound
    Like a monks with leathern girdle round
    Wild with the toss of mishorn hair
    And wringing of hands and eyes aglare
    Groaning under the worlds despair
    Grave pastors grieving their flocks to lose
    Prophesied to the empty pews
    That gourds would wither and mushrooms

    die
    And noisiest fountains run soonest dry
    Like the spring that gushed in Newbury

    Street
    Under the tramp of the earthquakes feet
    A silver shaft in the air and light
    For a single day then lost in night
    Leaving only its place to tell
    Sandy fissure and sulphurous smell
    With zeal wingclipped and whiteheat cool
    Moved by the spirit in grooves of ride
    No longer harried and cropped and

    fleeced
    Flogged by sheriff and cursed by priest
    But by wiser counsels left at ease
    To settle quietly on his lees
    And selfconcentred to count as done



    THE PREACHER



    73



    The work which his fathers well begun
    In sileut protest of letting alone
    The Quaker kept the way of his own
    A nonconductor among the wires
    With coat of asbestos proof to fires
    And quite unable to mend his pace
    To catch the falling mamia of grace
    He hugged the closer liis little store
    Of faith and silently prayed for more
    And vague of creed and barren of rite
    But holding as in his Masters sight
    Act and thought to the inner light
    The roimd of his simple duties walked
    And strove to live what the others talked

    And who shall marvel if evil went
    Step by step with the good intent
    And with love and meekness side by side
    Lust of the flesh and spiritual pride
    That passionate longings and fancies vain
    Set the heart on fire and crazed the brain
    That over the holy oracles
    Folly sported witli cap and bells
    That goodly women and learned men
    Marvelling told with tongue and pen
    How unweaned children chirped like birds
    Texts of Scripture and solemn words
    Like the infant seers of the rocky glens
    In the Puy de Dome of wild Ceveimes
    Or baby Lamas who pray and preach
    From Tartar cradles in Buddhas speech

    In the war which Truth or Freedom wages
    With impious fraud and the wrong of ages
    Hate and malice and selflove mar
    The notes of triumph with painful jar
    And the helping angels turn aside
    Their sorrowing faces the shame to hide
    Never on customs oiled grooves
    The world to a higher level moves
    But grates and grinds with friction hard
    On granite boulder and flinty shard
    The heart must bleed before it feels
    The pool be troubled before it heals
    Ever by losses the right must gain
    Every good have its birth of pain
    The active Virtues blush to find
    The Vices wearing their badge behind
    And Graces and Charities feel the fire
    Wherein the sins of the age expire
    The fiend still rends as of old he rent
    The tortured body from which he went

    But Time tests all In the overdrift
    And flow of the Nile with its annual gift



    Who cares for the Hadjis relics sunk
    Who thinks of the drowned  out Coptic

    monk
    The tide that loosens the temples stones
    And scatters the sacred ibisbones
    Drives away from the valleyland
    That Arab robber the wandering sand
    Moistens the fields that know no rain
    Fringes the desert with belts of grain
    And bread to the sower brings again
    So the flood of emotion deep and strong
    Troubled the land as it swept along
    But left a result of holier lives
    Tenderer mothers and worthier wives
    The husband and father whose children fled
    And sad wife wept when his drunken tread
    Frightened peace from his rooftrees shade
    And a rock of oflence his hearthstone made
    In a strength that was not his ovn began
    To rise from the brutes to the plane of

    man
    Old friends embraced long held apart
    By evil counsel and pride of heart
    And penitence saw through misty tears
    In the bow of hope on its cloud of feais
    The promise of Heavens eternal years
    The peace of God for the worlds an
    noy
    Beauty for ashes and oil of joy

    Under the church of Federal Street
    Under the tread of its Sabbath feet
    Walled about by its basement stones
    Lie the marvellous preachers bones
    No samtly honors to them are shown
    No sign nor miracle have they known
    But he who passes the ancient chiuch
    Stops in the shade of its belfryporch
    And ponders the wonderful life of him
    Who lies at rest in that charnel dim
    Long shall the traveller strain his eye
    From the railroad car as it plunges by
    And the vanishing town behind him search
    For the slender spire of the Whitefield

    Church
    And feel for one moment the ghosts of

    trade
    And fashion and folly and pleasure laid
    By the thought of that life of pure intent
    That voice of warning yet eloquent
    Of one on the errands of angels sent
    And if where he labored the flood of sin
    Like a tide from the harborbar sets in
    And over a life of time and sense
    The churchspires lift their vain defence

    As if to scatter tlie bolts of God

    THE TRUCE OF PISCATAQUA

    In the winter of 167576 the Eastern Indi
    ans who had been making war upon the New
    Hampshire settlements were so reduced in
    numbers by fighting and famine that they
    agreed to a peace with Major Waldron at
    Dover  but the peace was broken in the fall
    of 1673 The famous chief Squando was the
    principal negotiator on the part of the savages
    He had taken up the batchet to revenge the
    brutal treatment of his child by diimken white
    sailors which caused its death

    It not unfrequently happened during the
    Border wars that young white children were
    adopted by their Indian captors and so kindly
    treated that they were unwilling to leave the
    free wild life of the woods  and in some in
    stances they utterly refused to go back with
    their parents to their old liomes and civilization

    Raze these long blocks of brick and stone
    These huge millmonsters overgrown
    Blot out the humbler piles as well
    Where moved like living shuttles dwell
    The weaving genii of the bell
    Tear from the wild Cochecos track
    The dams that hold its torrents back
    And let the loudrejoicing fall
    Plunge roaring down its rocky wall
    And let the Indians paddle play
    On the unbridged Piscataqua
    Wide over hill and valley spread
    Once more the forest dusk and dread
    With here and there a clearing cut
    From the walled shadows round it shut
    Each with its farmhouse builded rude
    By English yeoman squared and hewed
    And the grim flankered blockhouse bound
    With bristling palisades around
    So haply shall before thine eyes
    The dusty veil of centuries rise
    The old strange scenery overlay
    The tamer pictures of today
    While like the actors in a play
    Pass in their ancient guise along
    The figures of my border song
    What time beside Cochecos flood
    The white man and the red man stood
    With words of peace and brotherhood



    When passed the sacred calumet
    From lip to lip with firedraught wet
    And puffed in scorn the peacepipes

    smoke
    Through the gray beard of Waldron

    broke
    And Squandos voice in suppliant plea
    For mercy struck the haughty key
    Of one who held in any fate
    His native pride inviolate

    Let your ears be opened wide
    He who speaks has never lied
    Waldron of Piscataqua
    Hear what Squando has to say

    Squando shuts his eyes and sees
    Far off Sacos hemlocktrees
    In his wigwam still as stone
    Sits a woman all alone

    Wampum beads and birchen strands
    Dropping from her careless hands
    Listening ever for the fleet
    Patter of a dead childs feet

    When the moon a year ago
    Told the flowers the time to blow
    In that lonely wigwam smiled
    Menewee our little child

    Ere that moon grew thin and old
    He was lying still and cold
    Sent before us weak and small
    When the Master did not call

    On his little grave I lay
    Three times went and came the day
    Thrice above me blazed the noon
    Thrice upon me wept the moon

    In the third nightwatch I heard
    Far and low a spiritbird
    Very mournful very wild
    Sang the totem of my child

    Menewee poor Menewee
    Walks a path he cannot see
    Let the white mans wigwam light
    With its blaze his steps aright

    Alluncalled he dares not show
    Empty hands to Manito
    Better gifts he cannot bear
    Than the scalps his slayers wear



    THE TRUCE OF PISCATAQUA



    75



    All the while the totem sang
    Lightuiug blazed and thunder rang
    And a black cloud reaching high
    Pulled the white moon from the sky

    I the medicineman whose ear
    All that spirits hear can hear
    I whose eyes are wide to see
    All the things that are to be

    Well I knew the dreadful signs
    In the whispers of the pines
    In the river roaring loud
    In the mutter of the cloud

    At the breaking of the day
    From the grave I passed away
    Flowers bloomed round me birds

    glad
    But my heart was hot and mad

    There is rust on Squandos knife
    From the warm red springs of life
    On the funeral hemlocktrees
    Many a scalp the totem sees

    Blood for blood  But evermore
    Squandos heart is sad and sore
    And his poor squaw waits at home
    For the feet that never come

    Waldron of Cocheco hear
    Squando speaks who laughs at fear
    Take the captives he has taen
    Let the land have peace again

    As the words died on his tongue
    Wide apart his warriors swung
    Parted at the sign lie gave
    Right and left like Egypts wave

    And like Israel passing free
    Through the prophetcharmed sea
    Captive mother wife and child
    Through the dusky terror filed

    One alone a little maid
    Middleway her steps delayed
    Glancing with quick troubled sight
    Round about from red to white

    Then his hand the Indian laid
    On the little maidens head
    Lightly from her forehead fair
    Smoothing back her yellow hair



    sang



    Gift or favor ask I none
    What I have is all my own
    Never yet the birds have sung
    Squando hath a beggars tongue

    Yet for her who waits at home
    For the dead who cannot come
    Let the little Goldhair be
    In the place of Menewee

    Mishanock my little star
    Come to Sacos pines afar
    Where the sad one waits at home
    Wequashim my moonlight come

    What   quoth Waldron  leave a

    child
    Christianborn to heathens wild
    As God lives from Satans hand
    I will pluck her as a brand

    Hear me white man   Squando cried
    Let the little one decide
    Wequashim my moonlight say
    Wilt thou go with me or stay

    Slowly sadly half afraid

    Half regretfully the maid

    Owned the ties of blood and race

    Turned from Squandos pleading face

    Not a word the Indian spoke
    But his wampum chain he broke
    And the beaded wonder hung
    On that neck so fair and young

    Silenceshod as phantoms seem
    In the marches of a dream
    Singlefiled the grim array
    Through the pinetrees wound away

    Doubting trembling sore amazed
    Through her tears the young child gazed
    God preserve her   Waldron said
    Satan hath bewitched the maid

    Years went and came At close of day
    Singing came a child from play
    Tossing from her looselocked head
    Gold in sunshine brown in shade

    Pride was in the mothers look
    But her head she gravely shook
    And with lips that fondly smiled
    Feigned to chide her truant child

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Unabashed the maid began
    Up and down the brook I ran
    Where beneath the bank so steep
    Lie the spotted trout asleep

    Chip   went squirrel on the wall
    After me I heard him call
    And the catbird on the tree
    Tried his best to mimic me

    Where the hemlocks grew so dark
    That I stopped to look and hark
    On a log with featherhat
    By the path an Indian sat

    Then I cried and ran away
    But he called and bade me stay
    And his voice was good and mild
    As my mothers to her child

    And he took my wampum chain
    Looked and looked it oer again
    Gave me berries and beside
    On my neck a plaything tied

    Straight the mother stooped to see
    What the Indians gift might be
    On the braid of wampum hung
    Lo  a cross of silver swung

    Well she knew its graven sign
    Squandos bird and totem pine
    And a mirage of the brain
    Flowed her childhood back again

    Flashed the roof the sunshine through
    Into space the walls outgrew
    On the Indians wigwammat
    Blossomcrowned again he sat

    Cool she felt the westwind blow
    In her ear the pines sang low
    And like links from out a chain
    Dropped the years of care and pain

    From the outward toil and din
    From the griefs that gnaw within
    To the freedom of the woods
    Called the birds and winds and floods

    Well O painful minister
    Watch thy flock but blame not her
    If her ear grew sharp to hear
    All their voices whispering near



    Blame her not as to her soul
    All the deserts glamour stole
    That a tear for childhoods loss
    Dropped upon the Lidians cross

    When that night the Book was read
    And she bowed her widowed head
    And a prayer for each loved name
    Rose like incense from a flame

    With a hope the creeds forbid
    In her pitying bosom hid
    To the listening ear of Heaven
    Lo  the Indians name was given

    MY PLAYMATE

    When written this poem bore the title
    Eleanor and when first printed The Playmate

    The pines were dark on Ramoth hill

    Their song was soft and low
    The blossoms in the sweet May wind

    Were falling like the snow

    The blossoms drifted at our feet
    The orchard birds sang clear

    The sweetest and the saddest day
    It seemed of all the year

    For more to me than birds or flowers

    My playmate left her home
    And took with her the laughing spring

    The music and the bloom

    She kissed the lips of kith and kin

    She laid her hand in mine
    What more could ask the bashful boy

    Who fed her fathers kine

    She left us in the bloom of May

    The constant years told oer
    Their seasons with as sweet May morns

    But she came back no more

    I walk with noiseless feet the round

    Of uneventful years
    Still oer and oer I sow the spring

    And reap the autumn ears

    She lives where all the golden year

    Her summer roses blow
    The dusky children of the sun

    Before her come and go

    There liaply with her jewelled hands
    She smooths her silken gown

    No more the homespun lap wherein
    I shook the walnuts down

    The wild grapes wait iis by the brook

    The brown nuts on the hill
    And still the Mayday Howers make sweet

    The woods of FoUymill

    The lilies blossom in the pond

    The bird builds in the tree
    The dark pines sing on Ramoth bill

    The slow song of the sea

    I wonder if she thinks of them
    And how the old time seems

    If ever the pines of Ramoth wood
    Are sounding in her dreams

    I see her face I hear her voice

    Does she remember mine
    And what to her is now the boy

    Who fed her fathers kine

    What cares she that the orioles build

    For other eyes than ours
    That other hands with nuts are filled

    And other laps with flowers

    O playmate in the golden time

    Our mossy seat is green
    Its fringing violets blossom yet

    The old trees oer it lean

    The winds so sweet with birch and fern

    A sweeter memory blow
    And there in spring the veeries sing

    The song of long ago

    And still the pines of Ramoth wood

    Are moaning like the sea
    The moaning of the sea of change

    Between myself and thee



    COBBLER KEEZARS VISION

    This ballad was written on the occasion of a
    Horticultural Festival Cobbler Keezar was a
    noted character among the first settlers in the
    valley of the Meiuimac

    The beaver cut his timber
    With patient teeth that day



    The minks were fishwards and the crows
    Surveyors of highway

    When Keezar sat on the hillside

    Upon his cobblers form
    With a pan of coals on either hand

    To keep his waxedends warm

    And there in the golden weather

    He stitched and hammered and sung

    In the brook he moistened his leather
    In the jjewter mug his tongue

    Well knew the tough old Teuton
    Who brewed the stoutest ale

    And he paid the goodwifes reckoning
    In the coin of song and tale

    The songs they still are singing

    Who dress the hills of vine
    The tales that haunt the Brocken

    And whisper down the Rhine

    Woodsy and wild and lonesome
    The swift stream wound away

    Through birches and scarlet maples
    Flashing in foam and spray

    Down on the sharphorned ledges

    Plunging in steep cascade
    Tossing its whitemaned waters

    Against the hemlocks shade

    Woodsy and wild and lonesome

    East and west and north and south

    Only the village of fishers
    Down at the rivers mouth

    Only here and there a clearmg

    With its farmhouse rude and new

    And treestumps swart as Indians
    Where the scanty harvest grew

    No shout of homebound reapers

    No vintagesong he heard
    And on the green no dancing feet

    The merry violin stirred

    Why should folk be glum said Keezar
    When Nature herself is glad

    And the painted woods arc laughing
    At the faces so sour and sad

    Small heed had the careless cobbler
    What sorrow of heart was theirs

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Who travailed in pain with the births of
    God
    And planted a state with prayers

    Hunting of witches and warlocks
    Smiting the heathen horde

    One hand on the masons trowel
    And one on the soldiers sword

    But give him his ale and cider

    Give him his pipe and song
    Little he cared for Church or State

    Or the balance of right and wrong

    Tis work work work he muttered
    And for rest a snuffle of psalms

    He smote on his leathern apron
    With his brown and waxen palms

    Oh for the purple harvests

    Of the days wlaen I was young

    For the merry grapestained maidens
    And the pleasant songs they sung

    Oh for the breath of vineyards

    Of apples and nuts and wine
    For an oar to row and a breeze to blow

    Down the grand old river Rhine

    A tear in his blue eye glistened
    And dropped on his beard so gray

    Old old am I said Keezar

    And the Rhine flows far away

    But a cunning man was the cobbler

    He could call the birds from the
    trees
    Charm the black snake out of the
    ledges
    And bring back the swarming bees

    All the virtues of herbs and metals
    All the lore of the woods he knew

    And the arts of the Old World mingled
    With the marvels of the New

    Well he knew the tricks of magic

    And the lapstone on his knee
    Had the gift of the Mormons goggles

    Or the stone of Doctor Dee

    For the mighty master Agrippa
    Wrought it with spell and rhyme

    From a fragment of mystic moonstone
    In the tower of Nettesheim



    To a cobbler Minnesinger

    The marvellous stone gave he

    And he gave it in turn to Keezar
    Who brought it over the sea

    He held up that mystic lapstone

    He held it up like a lens
    And he coimted the long years coming

    By twenties and by tens

    One hundred years quoth Keezar

    And fifty have I told
    Now open the new before me

    And shut me out the old

    Like a cloud of mist the blackness

    Rolled from the magic stone
    And a marvellous picture mingled

    The unknown and the known

    Still ran the stream to the river

    And river and ocean joined
    And there were the bluffs and the blue sea
    line

    And cold north hills behind

    But the mighty forest was broken

    By many a steepled town
    By many a whitewalled farmhouse

    And many a garner brown

    Turning a score of millwheels
    The stream no more ran free

    White sails on the winding river
    White sails on the farolf sea

    Below in the noisy village

    The flags were floating gay
    And shone on a thousand faces

    The light of a holiday

    Swiftly the rival ploughmen

    Turned the brown earth from their shares
    Here were the farmers treasures

    There were the craftsmans wares

    Golden the goodwifes butter

    Ruby her currantwine
    Grand were the strutting turkeys

    Fat were the beeves and swine

    Yellow and red were the apples
    And the ripe pears russetbrown

    And the peaches had stolen blushes
    From the sirls who shook them down

    And with blooms of hill and wildwood

    That shame the toil of art
    Mingled the gorgeous blossoms

    Of the gardens tropic heart

    What is it I see   said Keezar

    Am I here or am I there
    Is it a fete at Bingen

    Do I look on Frankfort fair

    But where are the clowns and puppets
    And imps with horns and tail

    And where are the Rhenish flagons
    And where is the foaming ale

    Strange things I know will happen
    Strange things the Lord permits

    But that droughty folk should be jolly
    Puzzles my poor old wits

    Here are smiling manly faces
    And the maidens step is gay

    Nor sad by thinking nor mad by drink
    ing
    Nor mopes nor fools are they

    Here s pleasure without regretting

    And good without abuse
    The holiday and the bridal

    Of beauty and of use

    Here s a priest and there is a Quaker

    Do the cat and dog agree
    Have they burned the stocks for ovenwood

    Have they cut down the gallowstree

    Would the old folk know their children

    Would they own the graceless town
    With never a ranter to worry

    And never a witch to drown

    Loud laughed the cobbler Keezar
    Laughed like a schoolboy gay

    Tossing his arms above him
    The lapstone rolled away

    It rolled down the rugged hillside
    It spun like a wheel bewitched

    It plunged through the leaning willows
    And into the river pitched

    There in the deep dark water

    The magic stone lies still
    Under the leaning willows

    In the shadow of the hill



    But oft the idle fisher

    Sits on the shadowy bank
    And his dreams make marvellous pictures

    Where the wizards lapstone sank

    And still in the summer twilights

    When the river seems to run
    Out from the inner glory

    Warm with the melted sun

    The weary millgirl lingers

    Beside the charmed stream
    And the sky and the golden water

    Shape and color her dream

    Fair wave the sunset gardens

    The rosy signals fly
    Her homestead beckons from the cloud

    And love goes sailing by

    TO WILLIAM BRADFORD

    As they who watch by sickbeds find relief
    Unwittingly from the great stress of grief
    And anxious care in fantasies outwrought
    From the hearths embers flickering low or

    caught
    From whispering wind or tread of passing

    feet
    Or vagrant memory calling up some sweet
    Snatch of old song or romance whence or

    why
    They scarcely know or ask  so thou and I
    Nursed in the faith that Truth alone is

    strong
    In the endurance which outwearies Wrong
    With meek persistence baffling brutal force
    And trusting God against the universe
    We doomed to watch a strife we may not

    share
    With other weapons than the patriots

    Who give their loved ones for the living wall
    Twixt law and treason  in this evil day
    May haply find through automatic play
    Of pen and pencil solace to our pain
    And hearten others with the strength we

    gain

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    I know it has been said our times require
    No play of art nor dalliance with the lyre
    No weak essay with Fancys chloroform
    To calm the hot mad pulses of the storm
    But the stern warblast rather such as sets
    The battles teeth of serried bayonets
    And pictures grim as Vernets Yet with

    these
    Some softer tints may blend and milder

    keys
    Relieve the stormstunned ear Let us

    keep sweet
    If so we may our hearts even while we eat
    The bitter harvest of our own device
    And half a centurys moral cowardice
    As Niirnberg sang while Wittenberg defied
    And Kranach painted by his Luthers side
    And through the warmarch of the Puritan
    The silver stream of Marvells music ran
    So let the household melodies be sung
    The pleasant pictures on the wall be hung
    So let us hold against the hosts of night
    And slavery all our vantageground of light
    Let Treason boast its savagery and shake
    From its flagfolds its symbol iattlesnake
    Nurse its fine arts lay human skins in tan
    And carve its pipebowls from the bones of

    man
    And make the tale of Fijian banquets dull
    By drinking whiskey from a loyal skull
    But let us guard till this sad war shall cease
    God grant it soon  the graceful arts of

    peace
    No foes are conquered who the victors teach
    Their vandal manners and barbaric speech

    And while with hearts of thankfulness we

    bear
    Of the great common burden our full share
    Let none upbraid us that the waves entice
    Thy seadipped pencil or some quaint de
    vice
    Rhythmic and sweet beguiles my pen away
    From the sharp strifes and sorrows of to
    day
    Thus while the eastwind keen from Lab
    rador
    Sings in the leafless elms and from the shore
    Of the great sea comes the monotonous roar
    Of the longbreaking surf and all the sky
    Is gray with cloud homebound and dull I

    try
    To time a simple legend to the sounds
    Of winds in the woods and waves on peb
    bled bounds



    A song for oars to chime with such as might
    Be sung by tired seapainters who at night
    Look from their hemlock camps by quiet

    cove
    Or beach moonlighted on the waves they

    love
    So hast thou looked when level sunset

    lay
    On the calm bosom of some Eastern bay
    And all the spraymoist rocks and waves

    that rolled
    Up the white sandslopes flashed with ruddy

    gold
    Something it has  a flavor of the sea
    And the seas freedom  which reminds of

    thee
    Its faded picture dimly smiling down
    From the blurred fresco of the ancient

    town
    I have not touched with warmer tints in

    vain
    If in tliis dark sad year it steals one

    thought from pain



    Her fingers shame the ivory keys

    They dance so light along
    The bloom upon her parted lips

    Is sweeter than the song

    O perfumed suitor spare thy smiles

    Her thoughts are not of thee
    She better loves the salted wind

    The voices of the sea

    Her heart is like an outbound ship

    That at its anchor swings
    The murmur of the stranded shell

    Is in the song she sings

    She sings and smiling hears her praise
    But dreams the while of one

    Who watches from his seablown deck
    The icebergs in the sun

    She questions all the winds that blow

    And every fogVTeath dim
    And bids the seabirds flying north

    Bear messages to him

    She speeds them with the thanks of men

    He perilled life to save
    And grateful prayers like holy oil

    To smooth for him the wave



    THE COUNTESS



    Brown Viking of the fishingsmack

    Fair toast of all the town
    The skippers jerkin ill beseems

    The ladys silken gown

    But neer shall Amy Wentworth wear

    For him the blush of shame
    Who dares to set his manly gifts

    Against her ancient name

    The stream is brightest at its spring

    And blood is not like wine
    Nor honored less than he who heirs

    Is he who founds a line

    Full lightly shall the prize be won

    If love be Fortunes spur
    And never maiden stoops to him

    Who lifts himself to her

    Her home is brave in Jaffrey Street
    With stately stairways worn

    By feet of old Colonial knights
    And ladies gentleborn

    Still green about its ample porch

    The English ivy twines
    Trained back to show in English oak

    The heralds carven signs

    And on her from the wainscot old

    Ancestral faces frown
    And this has worn the soldiers sword

    And that the judges gown

    But strong of will and proud as they

    She Avalks the gallery floor
    As if she trod her sailors deck

    By stormy Labrador

    The sweetbrier blooms on Kitteryside
    And green are Elliots bowers

    Her garden is the pebbled beach
    The mosses are her flowers

    She looks across the harborbar

    To see the white gulls fly
    His greeting from the Northern sea

    Is in their clanging cry

    She hums a song and dreams that
    he

    As in its romance old
    Shall homeward ride with silken sails

    And masts of beaten gold



    Oh rank is good and gold is fair
    And high and low mate ill

    But love has never known a law
    Beyond its own sweet will



    THE COUNTESS

    TO E W

    I inscribed this poem to Dr Elias Weld of
    Haverhill Massachusetts to whose kindness I
    was much indebted in my boyhood He was
    the one cultivated man in the neighborhood
    His small but wellchosen library was placed at
    my disposal He is the  wise old doctor  of
    SnowBound

    Count Francois de Vipart with his cousin
    Joseph Rochemont de Poyen came to the
    United States in the early part of the jiresent
    century They took up their residence at
    Rocks Village on the Merrimae where they
    both mairied The wife of Count Vipart was
    Mary Ingalls who as my father remembered
    her was a very lovely young girl Her wed
    dmg dress as described by a lady still living
    was  pmk satin with an overdress of white lace
    and white satin slippers  She died in less than
    a year after her marriage Her husband re
    turned to his native country He lies buried in
    the family tomb of the Viparts at Bordeaux
    See note at end of volume

    I KNOW not Time and Space so intervene
    Whether still waiting with a trust serene
    Thou bearest up thy fourscore years and ten
    Or called at last art now Heavens citizen
    But here or there a pleasant thought of

    thee
    Like an old friend all day has been with me
    The shy still boy for whom thy kindly hand
    Smoothed his hard pathway to the wonder
    land
    Of thought and fancy in gray manhood yet
    Keeps green the memory of his early debt
    Today when truth and falsehood sjieak

    their words
    Through hotlipped cannon and the teeth

    of swords
    Listening with quickened heart and ear in
    tent
    To each sharp clause of that stern argu
    ment
    I still can hear at times a softer note
    Of the old pastoral music round me float
    While through the hot gleam of our civil
    strife

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Looms the green mirage of a simpler life
    As at his alien post the sentinel
    Drops the old bucket in the homestead well
    And hears old voices in the winds that toss
    Above his head the liveoaks beard of moss
    So in our trialtime and under skies
    Shadowed by swords like Islams paradise
    I wait and watch and let my fancy stray
    To milder scenes and youths Arcadian day
    And howsoeer the pencil dipped in dreams
    Shades the brown woods or tints the sun
    set streams
    The covintry doctor in the foreground seems
    Whose ancient sulky down the village lanes
    Dragged like a warcar captive ills and

    pains
    I could not paint the scenery of my song
    Mindless of one who looked thereon so

    long
    Who night and day on dutys lonely round
    Made friends o the woods and rocks and

    knew the sound
    Of each small brook and what the hillside

    trees
    Said to the winds that touched their leafy

    keys
    Who saw so keenly and so well coidd paint
    The villagefolk with all their humors

    quaint
    The parson ambling on his walleyed roan
    Grave and erect with white hair backward

    blown
    The tough old boatman half amphibious

    grown
    The muttering witchwife of the gossips

    tale
    And the loud straggler levying his black
    mail
    Old customs habits superstitions fears
    All that lies buried under fifty years
    To thee as is most fit I bring my lay
    And grateful own the debt I cannot pay



    Over the wooded northern ridge

    Between its houses brown
    To the dark tunnel of the bridge



    You catch a glimpse through birch and
    pine

    Of gable roof and porch
    The tavern with its swinging sign

    The sharp horn of the church



    The rivers steelblue crescent curves

    To nieet in ebb and flow
    The single broken wharf that serves

    For sloop and gundelow

    With salt seascents along its shores

    The heavy hayboats crawl
    The long antennae of their oars

    In lazy rise and fall

    Along the gray abutments wall

    The idle shadnet dries
    The tollman in his cobblers stall

    Sits smoking vith closed eyes

    You hear the piers low imdertone
    Of waves that chafe and gnaw

    You start  a skippers horn is blown
    To raise the creaking draw

    At times a blacksmiths anvil sounds

    With slow and sluggard beat
    Or stagecoach on its dusty rounds

    Wakes up the staring street

    A place for idle eyes and ears
    A cob webbed nook of dreams

    Left by the stream whose waves are
    years
    The stranded village seems

    And there like other moss and rust

    The native dweller clings
    And keeps in uninquiring trust

    The old dull round of things

    The fisher drops his patient lines

    The farmer sows his grain
    Content to hear the miumuring pines

    Instead of railroad train

    Go where along the tangled steep

    That slopes against the west
    The hamlets buried idlers sleep

    In still profounder rest

    Throw back the locusts flowery plume

    The birchs palegreen scarf
    And break the web of brier and bloom

    From name and epitaph

    A simple musterroll of death

    Of pomp and romance shorn
    The dry old names that common breath

    Has cheapened and outworn



    THE COUNTESS



    83



    Yet pause by one low mound and part

    The wild vines oer it laced
    And read the words by rustic art

    Upon its headstone traced

    Haply yon whitehaired villager

    Of fourscore years can say
    What means the noble name of her

    Who sleeps with common clay

    An exile from the Gascon land

    Found Iefuge here and rest
    And loved of all the village band

    Its fairest and its best

    He knelt with her on Sabbath morns
    He worshipped through her eyes

    And on the pride that doubts and scorns
    Stole in her faiths surprise

    Her simple daily life he saw

    By homeliest duties tried
    In all things by an untaught law

    Of fitness justified

    For her his rank aside he laid

    He took the hue and tone
    Of lowly life and toil and made

    Her simple ways his own

    Yet still in gay and careless ease

    To harvestfield or dance
    He brought the gentle courtesies

    The nameless grace of France

    And she who taught him love not less

    From him she loved in turn
    Caught in her sweet unconsciousness

    What love is quick to learn

    Each grew to each in pleased accord

    Nor knew the gazing town
    If she looked upward to her lord

    Or he to her looked down

    How sweet when summers day was
    oer

    His violins mirth and wail
    The walk on pleasant Newburys shore

    The rivers moonlit sail

    Ah  life is brief though love be long

    The altar and the bier
    The burial hymn and bridal song

    Were both in one short jear



    Her rest is quiet on the hill
    Beneath the locusts bloom

    Far off her lover sleeps as still
    Witliin his scutcheoned tomb

    The Gascon lord the village maid
    In death still clasp their hands

    The love that levels rank and grade
    Unites their severed lands

    What matter whose the hillside grave
    Or whose the blazoned stone

    Forever to her western wave
    Shall whisper blue Garonne

    O Love   so hallowing every soil
    That gives thy sweet flower room

    Wherever nursed by ease or toil
    The human heart takes bloom

    Plant of lost Eden from the sod

    Of sinful earth unriven
    White blossom of the trees of God

    Dropped down to us from heaven

    This tangled waste of mound and stone

    Is holy for thy sake
    A sweetness which is all thy own

    Breathes out from fern and brake

    And while ancestral pride shall twine
    The Gascons tomb with flowers

    Fall sweetly here O song of mine
    With summers bloom and showers

    And let the lines that severed seem

    Unite again in thee
    As western wave and Gallic stream

    Are mingled in one sea



    AMONG THE HILLS

    This poem when originally published was
    dedicated to Annie Fields wife of the distin
    gTiished publisher James T Fields of Boston
    in grateful acknowledgment of the strength
    and inspiration I have found in her friendsliij
    and sympathy

    The poem in its first form was entitled The
    Wife an Idyl of Bearcamp Water and ap
    peared in The Atlantic Monthly for January
    1868 When I published the volume Among
    the Hills in December of the same year I ex
    panded the Prelude and filled out also the out
    lines of the story

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    PRELUDE

    Along the roadside like the flowers of

    gold
    That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought
    Heavy with sunshine droops the goldeurod
    And the red pennons of the caidinalflowers
    Hang motionless upon their upright staves
    The sky is hot and hazy and the wind
    Wingweary with its long flight from the

    south
    Unfelt  yet closely scanned yon maple

    leaf
    With faintest motion as one stirs in dreams
    Confesses it The locust by the wall
    Stabs the noonsilence with his sharp alarm
    A single haycart down the dusty road
    Creaks slowly with its driver fast asleep
    On the loads top Against the neighbor
    ing hill
    Huddled along the stone walls shady aide
    The sheep show white as if a snowdrift

    still
    Defied the dogstar Through the open

    door
    A drowsy smell of flowers  gray helio
    trope
    And white sweet clover and shy mignon
    ette
    Comes faintly in and silent cliorus lends
    To the pervading symphony of peace

    No time is this for hands long overworn
    To task their strength and unto Him be

    praise
    AVho giveth quietness  the stress and

    strain
    Of years that did the work of centuries
    Have ceased and we can draw our breath

    once more
    Freely and full So as yon harvesters
    Make glad their nooning underneath the

    elms
    With tale and riddle and old snatch of song
    I lay aside grave themes and idly turn
    The leaves of memorys sketchbook dream
    ing oer
    Old summer pictures of the quiet hills
    And human life as quiet at their feet

    And yet not idly all A farmers son
    Proud of fieldlore and harvest craft and

    feeling
    All their fine possibilities how rich
    And restful even poverty and toil



    Become when beauty harmony and love
    Sit at their humble hearth as angels sat
    At evening in the patriarchs tent when man
    Makes labor noble and his farmers frock
    The symbol of a Christian chivalry
    Tender and just and generous to her
    Who clothes with grace all duty  still I

    know
    Too well the picture has another side
    How wearily the grind of toil goes on
    Where love is wanting how the eye and

    ear
    And heart are starved amidst the plenitude
    Of nature and how hard and colorless
    Is life without an atmosphere I look
    Across the lapse of half a century
    And call to mind old homesteads where no

    flower
    Told that the spring had come but evil

    weeds
    Nightshade and roughleaved burdock in

    the place
    Of the sweet doorway greeting of the rose
    And honeysuckle where the house walls

    seemed
    Blistering in sun without a tree or vine
    To cast the tremulous shadow of its leaves
    Across tlie curtainless windows from whose

    panes
    Fluttered the signal rags of shiftlessness
    Within the cluttered kitchen floor un
    washed
    Broomclean I think they called it the

    best room
    Stifling with cellardamp shut from the air
    In hot midsiimmer bookless pictureless
    Save the inevitable sampler hung
    Over the fireplace or a mourning piece
    A greenhaired woman peonycheeked be
    neath
    Impossible willows  the wide  throated

    hearth
    Bristling wath faded pineboughs half con
    cealing
    The piled up rubbish at the chimneys

    back
    And in sad keeping with all things about

    them
    Shrill querulous women sour and sullen

    men
    Untidy loveless old before their time
    With scarce a human interest save their own
    Monotonous round of small economies
    Or the poor scandal of the neighborhood
    Blind to the beauty everywhere revealed



    AMONG THE HILLS



    8S



    Treading the Mayflowers with regardless

    feet
    For them the songsparrow and the bobolink
    Sang not nor winds made music in the

    leaves
    For them in vain Octobers holocaust
    Burned gold and crimson over all the hills
    The sacramental mystery of the woods
    Churchgoers fearful of the unseen Powers
    But grumbling over pulpittax and pew
    rent
    Saving as shrewd economists their souls
    And winter pork with the least possible

    outlay
    Of salt and sanctity  in daily life
    Showing as little actual comprehension
    Of Christian charity and love and duty
    As if the Sermon on the Mount had been
    Outdated like a last years almanac
    Rich in broad woodlands and in halftilled

    fields
    And yet so pinched and bare and comfort
    less
    The veriest straggler limping on his rounds
    The sun and air his sole inheritance
    Laughed at a poverty that paid its taxes
    And hugged his rags in selfcomplacency

    Not such should be the homesteads of a

    land
    Where whoso wisely wills and acts may

    dwell
    As king and lawgiver in broadacred state
    With beauty art taste culture books to

    make
    His hour of leisure richer than a life
    Of fourscore to the barons of old time
    Our yeoman should be equal to his home
    Set in the fair green valleys purple walled
    A man to match his mountains not to creep
    Dwarfed and abased below them I would

    fain
    In this light way of which I needs must

    own
    With the knifegrinder of whom Canning

    sings
    Story God bless you  I have none to tell

    you
    Invite the eye to see and heart to feel
    The beauty and the joy vnthin their reach
    Home and home loves and the beatitudes
    Of nature free to all Haply in years
    That wait to take the places of our own
    Heard where some breezy balcony looks

    down



    On happy homes or where the lake in the

    moon
    Sleeps dreaming of the mountains fair as

    Ruth
    In the old Hebrew pastoral at the feet
    Of Boaz even this simple lay of mine
    May seem the burden of a prophecy
    Finding its late fulfilment in a change
    Slow as the oaks growth lifting manhood up
    Through broader culture finer manners

    love
    And reverence to the level of the hills

    O Golden Age whose light is of the dawn
    And not of sunset forward not behind
    Flood the new heavens and earth and with

    thee bring
    All the old virtues whatsoever things
    Are pure and honest and of good repute
    But add thereto whatever bard has sung
    Or seer has told of when in trance and dream
    They saw the Happy Isles of prophecy
    Let Justice hold her scale and Truth divide
    Between the right and wrong  but give the

    heart
    The freedom of its fair inheritance
    Let the poor prisoner cramped and starved

    so long
    At Natures table feast his ear and eye
    With joy and wonder  let all harmonies
    Of somid form color motion wait upon
    The princely guest whether in soft attire
    Of leisure clad or the coarse frock of

    toil
    And lending life to the dead form of faith
    Give human nature reverence for the sake
    Of One who bore it making it divine
    With the ineffable tenderness of God
    Let common need tlie brotherhood of

    prayer
    The heirship of an unknown destiny
    The unsolved mystery round about us make
    A man more precious than the gold of Ophir
    Sacred inviolate unto whom all things
    Should minister as outward types and signs
    Of the eternal beauty which fulfils
    The one great purpose of creation Love
    The sole necessity of Earth and Heaven



    For weeks the clouds had raked the hills
    And vexed the vales with raining

    And all the woods were sad with mist
    And all the brooks complaining

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    At last a sudden nightstorm tore

    The mountain veils asunder
    And swept the valleys clean before

    The besom of the thunder

    Through Sandwich notch the westwind
    sang

    Good morrow to the cotter
    And once again Chocoruas horn

    Of shadow pierced the water

    Above his broad lake Ossipee

    Once more the sunshine wearing

    Stooped tracmg on that silver shield
    His grim armorial bearing

    Clear drawn against the hard blue sky
    The peaks had winters keenness

    And close on autumns frost the vales
    Had more than Junes fresh greenness

    Again the sodden forest floors

    With golden lights were checkered

    Once more rejoicing leaves in wind
    And sunshine danced and flickered

    It was as if the summers late

    Atoning for its sadness
    Had borrowed every seasons charm

    To end its days in gladness

    I call to mind those banded vales

    Of shadow and of shiniug
    Through which my hostess at my side

    I drove in days declining

    We held our sideling way above
    The rivers whitening shallows

    By homesteads old with wideflung barns
    Swept through and through by swallows

    By maple orchards belts of pine

    And larches climbing darkly
    The mountain slopes and over all

    The great peaks rising starkly

    You should have seen that long hillrange
    With gaps of brightness riven

    How through each pass and hollow streamed
    The purpling lights of heaven

    Rivers of goldmist flowing down
    From far celestial fountains

    The great sun flaming through the rifts
    Beyond the wall of mountains



    We paused at last where homebound cows
    Brought down the pastures treasure

    And in the barn the rhythmic flails
    Beat out a harvest measure

    We heard the nighthawks sullen plunge
    The crow his treemates calling

    The shadows lengthening down the slopes
    About our feet were falling

    And through them smote the level sun

    In broken lines of splendor
    Touched the gray rocks and made the
    green

    Of the shorn grass more tender

    The maples bending oer the gate
    Their arch of leaves just tinted

    With yellow warmth the golden glow
    Of coming autumn hinted

    Keen white between the farmhouse showed
    And smiled on porch and trellis

    The fair democracy of flowers
    That equals cot and palace

    And weaving garlands for her dog

    Twixt chidings and caresses
    A human flower of childhood shook

    The sunshine from her tresses

    On either hand we saw the signs

    Of fancy and of shrewdness
    Where taste had wound its arms of vines

    Round thrifts uncomely rudeness

    The sunbrown farmer in his frock
    Shook hands and called to Mary

    Barearmed as Juno might she came
    Whiteaproned from her dairy

    Her air her smile her motions told

    Of womanly completeness
    A music as of household songs

    Was in her voice of sweetness

    Not fair alone in curve and line
    But something more and better

    The secret charm eluding art
    Its spirit not its letter

    An inborn grace that nothing lacked

    Of culture or appliance
    The warmth of genial courtesy

    The calm of selfreliance



    AMONG THE HILLS



    87



    Before her queenly womanhood

    How dared our hostess utter
    The paltry errand of her need

    To buy her freshchurned butter

    She led the way with housewife pride

    Her goodly store disclosing
    Full tenderly the golden balls

    With practised hands disposing

    Then while along the western hills
    We watched the changeful glory

    Of sunset on our homeward way
    I heard her simple story

    The early crickets sang  the stream
    Plashed through my friends narration

    Her rustic patois of the hills
    Lost ill my free translation

    More wise she said  than those who
    swarm

    Our hills in middle summer
    She came when Junes first roses blow

    To greet the early comer

    From school and ball and rout she came

    The citys fair pale daughter
    To diink the wine of mountain air

    Beside the Bearcamp Water

    Her step grew firmer on the hills
    That watch our homesteads over

    On cheek and lip from summer fields
    She caught the bloom of clover

    For health comes sparkling in the streams
    From cool Chocorua stealing

    There s iron in our Northern winds
    Our pines are trees of healing

    She sat beneath the broadarmed elms
    That skirt the mowing meadow

    And watched the gentle westwind weave
    The grass with shine and shadow

    Beside her from the summer heat
    To share her grateful screening

    With forehead bared the farmer stood
    Upon his pitchfork leaning

    Framed in its damp dark locks his face
    Had nothing mean or common

    Strong manly true the tenderness
    And pride beloved of woman



    She looked up glowing with the health
    The country air had brought her

    And laughing said   You lack a wife
    Your mother lacks a daughter

    To mend your frock and bake your
    bread

    You do not need a lady
    Be sure among these brown old homes

    Is some one waiting ieady

    Some fair sweet girl with skilful hand
    And cheerful heart for treasure

    Who never played with ivory keys
    Or danced the polkas measure

    He bent his black brows to a frown

    He set his white teeth tightly
    T is well he said  for one like you

    To choose for me so lightly

    You think because my life is rude

    I take no note of sweetness
    I tell you love has naught to do

    With meetness or unmeetness

    Itself its best excuse it asks

    No leave of pride or fashion
    When silken zone or homespun frock

    It stirs with throbs of passion

    You think me deaf and blind  you bring

    Your winning graces hither
    As free as if from cradletime

    We two had played together

    You tempt me with your laughing eyes
    Your cheek of sundowns blushes

    A motion as of waving grain
    A music as of thrushes

    The plaything of your summer sport
    The spells you weave around me

    You cannot at your will undo
    Nor leave me as you found me

    You go as lightly as you came

    Your life is well without me
    What care you that these hills will close

    Like prisonwalls about me

    No mood is mine to seek a wife

    Or daughter for my mother
    Who loves you loses in that love

    All power to love another



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    I dare your pity or your scorn
    With pride your own exceeding

    I fling my heart into your lap
    Without a word of pleading

    She looked up in his face of pain

    So archly yet so tender
    And if I lend you mine she said

    Will you forgive the lender

    Nor frock nor tan can hide the man

    And see you not my farmer
    How weak and fond a woman waits

    Behind the silken armor

    I love you  on that love alone
    And not my worth presuming

    Will you not trust for summer fruit
    The tree in Mayday blooming

    Alone the hangbird overhead
    His hairswung cradle straining

    Looked down to see loves miracle
    The giving that is gaining

    And so the farmer found a wife
    His mother found a daughter

    There looks no happier home than hers
    On pleasant Bearcamp Water

    Flowers spring to blossom where she
    walks

    The careful ways of duty
    Our hard stiff lines of life with her

    Are flowing curves of beauty

    Our homes are cheerier for her sake
    Our dooryards brighter blooming

    And all about the social air
    Is sweeter for her coming

    Unspoken homilies of peace

    Her daily life is preaching
    The still refreshment of the dew

    Is her unconscious teaching

    And never tenderer hand than hers

    Unknits the brow of ailing
    Her garments to the sick mans ear

    Have music in their trailing

    And when in pleasant harvest moons

    The youthful buskers gather
    Or sleighdrives on the mountain ways

    Defy the winter weather



    In sugarcamps when south and warm
    The winds of March are blowing

    And sweetly from its thawing veins
    The maples blood is flowing

    In summer where some lilied pond

    Its virgin zone is baring
    Or where the ruddy autumn fire

    Lights up the appleparing

    The coarseness of a ruder time

    Her finer mirth displaces
    A subtler sense of pleasure fills

    Each rustic sport she graces

    Her presence lends its warmth and
    health

    To all who come before it
    If woman lost us Eden such

    As she alone restore it

    For larger life and wiser aims

    The farmer is her debtor
    Who holds to his anothers heart

    Must needs be worse or better

    Through her his civic service shows

    A purertoned ambition
    No double consciousness divides

    The man and politician

    In partys doubtful ways he trusts

    Her instincts to determine
    At the loud polls the thought of her

    Recalls Christs Mountain Sermon

    He owns her logic of the heart

    And wisdom of unreason
    Supplying while he doubts and weighs

    The needed word in season

    He sees with pride her richer thought

    Her fancys freer ranges
    And love thus deepened to respect

    Is proof against all changes

    And if she walks at ease in ways

    His feet are slow to travel
    And if she reads with cultured eyes

    What his may scarce unravel

    Still clearer for her keener sight

    Of beauty and of wonder
    He learns the meaning of the hills

    He dwelt from childhood under



    THE DOLE OF JARL THORKELL



    89



    And higher warmed with summer lights

    Or wiutercrowued and hoary
    The ridged horizon lifts for him

    Its inner veils of glory

    He has his own free bookless lore
    The lessons nature taught him

    The wisdom which the woods and hills
    And toiling men have brought him

    The steady force of will whereby
    Her flexile grace seems sweeter

    The sturdy counterpoise which makes
    Her womans life completer

    A latent fire of soul which lacks

    No breath of love to fan it
    And wit that like his native brooks

    Plays over solid granite

    How dwarfed against his manliness

    She sees the poor pretension
    The wants the aims the follies born

    Of fashion and convention

    How life behind its accidents
    Stands strong and selfsustaining

    The human fact transcending all
    The losing and the gaining

    And so in grateful interchange

    Of teacher and of hearer
    Their lives their true distinctness keep

    While daily drawing nearer

    And if the husband or the wife
    In homes strong light discovers

    Such slight defaults as failed to meet
    The blinded eyes of lovers

    Why need we care to ask   who
    dreams

    Without their thorns of roses
    Or wonders that the truest steel

    The readiest spark discloses

    For still in mutual sufferance lies

    The secret of true living
    Love scarce is love that never knows

    The sweetness of forgiving

    We send the Squire to General Court
    He takes his young wife thither

    No prouder man election day

    Rides through the sweet June weather



    He sees with eyes of manly trust

    All hearts to her inclining
    Not less for him his household light

    That others share its shining

    Thus while my hostess spake there grew

    Before me warmer tinted
    And outUned with a tenderer grace

    The picture that she hinted

    The sunset smouldered as we drove
    Beneath the deep hillshadows

    Below us wreaths of white fog walked
    Like ghosts the haunted meadows

    Somiding the siuiimer night the stars
    Dropped down their golden plummets

    The pale arc of the Northern lights
    Rose oer the mountain summits

    Until at last beneath its bridge
    We heard the Bearcamp flowing

    And saw across the mapled lawn
    The welcome homelights glowing

    And musing on the tale I heard
    T were well thought I if often

    To rugged farmlife came the gift
    To harmonize and soften

    If more and more we found the troth

    Of fact and fancy plighted
    And cultures charm and labors strength

    In rural homes united

    The simple life the homely hearth
    With beautys sphere surrounding

    And blessing toil where toil abounds
    With graces more abounding



    THE DOLE OF JARL THORKELL

    The land was pale with famine

    And racked with feverpain
    The frozen fiords were Ashless

    The earth withheld her grain

    Men saw the boding Fylgja

    Before them come and go
    And through their dreams the Urdarmoon

    From west to east sailed slow

    Jarl Thorkell of Thevera

    At Yuletime made his vow

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    On Rykclals lioly Doomstone
    He slew to Frey his cow

    To bovmteons Frey he slew her

    To Skuld the yoiuiger Norn
    Who watches over birth and death

    He gave her calf unborn

    And his little goldhaired daughter

    Took up the sprinklingrod
    And smeared with blood the temple

    And the wide lips of the god

    Hoarse below the winter water

    Ground its ice blocks oer and oer

    Jets of foam like ghosts of dead waves
    Rose and fell along the shore

    The red torch of the Jokul

    Aloft in icy space
    Shone down on the bloody Horgstones

    And the statues carven face

    And closer round and grimmer

    Beneath its baleful light
    The Jotun shapes of mountains

    Came crowding through the night

    The grayhaired Hersir trembled
    As a flame by wind is blown

    A weird power moved his white lips
    And their voice was not his own

    The sir thirst   he muttered

    The gods must have more blood
    Before the tun shall blossom

    Or fish shall fill the flood

    The sir thirst and hmiger
    And hence our blight and ban

    The mouths of the strong gods water
    For the flesh and blood of man

    Whom shall we give the strong ones

    Not warriors sword on thigh
    But let the nursling infant

    And bedrid old man die

    So be it   cried the young men
    There needs nor doubt nor parle

    But knitting hard his red brows
    In silence stood the Jarl

    A somid of womans weeping
    At the temple door was heard



    But the old men bowed their white heads
    And answered not a word

    Then the Dreamwife of Thingvalla

    A Vala yoiuig and fair
    Sang softly stirring with her breath

    The veil of her loose hair

    She sang   The winds from Alfheim

    Brmg never somid of strife
    The gifts for Frey the meetest

    Are not of death but life

    He loves the grassgreen meadows
    The grazing kines sweet breath

    He loathes your bloody Horgstones
    Your gifts that smell of death

    No viong by wrong is righted

    No pain is cured by pain
    The blood that smokes from Doomrings

    Falls back in redder rain

    The gods are what you make them
    As earth shall Asgard prove

    And hate will come of hating
    And love will come of love

    Make dole of skyr and black bread
    That old and yomig may live

    And look to Frey for favor
    When first like Frey you give

    Even now oer Njords seameadows

    The summer dawn begins
    The tun shall have its harvest

    The fiord its glancing fins

    Then up and swore Jarl Thorkell

    By Gimli and by Hel
    O Vala of Thingvalla

    Thou singest wise and well

    Too dear the sirs favors

    Bought with our childrens lives

    Better die than shame in living
    Our mothers and oiu wives

    The full shall give his portion
    To him who hath most need

    Aud each man at his bidding
    Brought gifts for young and old

    Then mothers nursed their cliildren
    And daughters fed their sires

    And Health sat down with Plenty
    Before the next Yide fires

    The Horgstones stand in Rykdal

    The Doomring still remains
    But the snows of a thousand winters

    Have washed away the stains

    THE TWO RABBINS

    The Rabbi Nathan twoscore years and ten
    Walked blameless through the evil world

    and then
    Just as the almond blossomed in his hair
    Met a temptation all too strong to bear
    And miserably sinned So adding not
    Falsehood to guilt he left his seat and

    taught
    No more among the elders but went out
    From the great congregation girt about
    With sackcloth and with ashes on his head
    Making his gray locks grayer Long he

    prayed
    Smiting his breast  then as the Book he

    laid
    Open before him for the BathCols choice
    Pausing to hear that Daughter of a Voice
    Behold the royal preachers words   A

    friend
    Loveth at all times yea unto the end
    And for the evil day thy brother lives
    Marvelling he said   It is the Lord who

    gives
    Coimsel in need At Ecbatana dwells
    Rabbi Ben Isaac who all men excels
    In righteousness and wisdom as the trees
    Of Lebanon the small weeds that the bees
    Bow with their weight I will arise aud

    My sins before him

    And he went his way
    Barefooted fasting long with many prayers
    But even as one who followed miawares



    Suddenly in the darkness feels a hand
    Thrill with its touch his own and his cheek

    fanned
    By odors subtly sweet and whispers near
    Of words he loathes yet cannot choose but

    hear
    So while the Rabbi journeyed chanting low
    The wail of Davids penitential woe
    Before him still the old temptation came
    And mocked him with the motion and the

    shame
    Of such desires that shuddering he ab
    horred
    Himself  and crying mightily to the Lord
    To free Ids soul and cast the demon out
    Smote with his staff the blankuess roimd
    about

    At length in the low light of a spent day
    The towers of Ecbatana far away
    Rose on the deserts rim  and Nathan faint
    And footsore pausing where for some dead

    saint
    The faith of Islam reared a domed tomb
    Saw some one kneeling in the shadow whom
    He greeted kindly   May the Holy One
    Answer thy prayers O stranger   Where
    upon
    The shape stood up with a loud cry and

    then
    Clasped in each others arms the two gray

    meu
    Wept praising Him whose gracious provi
    dence
    Made their paths one But straightway as

    the sense
    Of his transgression smote him Nathan tore
    Himself away   O friend beloved no

    more
    Worthy am I to touch thee for I came
    Foul from my sins to tell thee all my shame
    Haply thy prayers since naught availeth

    mine
    May purge my soul aud make it white like

    thine
    Pity me O Ben Isaac I have sinned

    Awestruck Ben Isaac stood The desert

    wind
    Blew his long mantle backward laying bare
    The mournful secret of his shirt of hair
    I too O friend if not in act he said
    In thought have verily sinned Hast

    thou not read
    Better the eye should see than that desire

    Should wander   Burning with a hidden

    fire
    That tears and prayers quench not I come

    to thee
    For pity and for help as thou to me
    Pray for me O my friend   But Nathan

    cried
    Pray thou for me Ben Isaac

    Side by side
    In the low simshine by the turban stone
    They knelt  each made his brothers woe

    his own
    Forgetting in the agony and stress
    Of pitying love his claim of selfishness
    Peace for his friend besought his own be
    came
    His prayers were answered in anothers

    name
    And when at last they rose up to embrace
    Each saw Gods pardon in his brothers face

    Long after when his headstone gathered

    moss
    Traced on the targiunmarge of Onlcelos
    In Rabbi Nathans hand these words were

    read
    Hope not the cure of sin till Self is dead
    Forget it in lovers service and the debt
    Thou canst not pay the angels shall forget
    Heavens gate is shut to him who comes alone
    Save thou a soul and it shall save thy own

    to a fabulous country south of Cajje Breton
    first discovered by Verrazzani m 1524 It was
    supposed to have a magnificent city of the
    same name on a great river probably the Pe
    nobscot The site of this barbaric city is laid
    down on a map published at Antwerp in 1570
    In 1604 Champlain sailed in search of the
    Northern Eldorado twentytwo leagues up the
    Penobscot from the Isle Haute He supposed
    the river to be that of Norembega but wisely
    came to the conclusion that those travellers
    who told of the great city had never seen it
    He saw no evidences of anything like civiliza
    tion but mentions the finding of a cross very
    old and mossy in the woods

    The winding way the serpent takes
    The mystic water took



    From where to count its beaded lakes
    The forest sped its brook

    A narrow space twixt shore and shore

    For sun or stars to fall
    While evermore behind before

    Closed in the forest wall

    The dim wood hiding underneath

    Wan flowers without a name
    Life tangled with decay and death

    League after league the same

    Unbroken over swamp and hill

    The rounding shadow lay
    Save where the river cut at will

    A pathway to the day

    Beside that track of air and light

    Weak as a child unweaned
    At shut of day a Christian knight

    Upon his henchman leaned

    The embers of the sunsets fires
    Along the clouds burned down

    I see he said  the domes and spires
    Of Norembega town

    Alack  the domes O master mine

    Are golden clouds on high
    Yon spire is but the branchless pine

    That cuts the evening sky

    Oh hush and hark  What sounds are these
    But chants and holy hymns

    Tliou hearst the breeze that stirs the trees
    Through all their leafy limbs

    Is it a chapel bell that fills

    The air with its low tone
    Thou hearst the tinkle of the rills

    The insects vesper drone

    The Christ be praised   He sets for me

    A blessed cross in sight
    Now nay t is but yon blasted tree

    With two gaunt arms outright

    Be it wind so sad or tree so stark

    It mattereth not my knave
    Methinks to funeral hymns I hark

    The cross is for my grave

    My life is sped  I shall not see
    My homeset sails again

    The sweetest eyes of Normanclie
    Shall watch for me in vain

    Yet onward still to ear and eye

    The baffling marvel calls
    I faiu would look before I die

    On Norembegas walls

    So haply it shall be thy part

    At Christian feet to lay
    The mystery of the deserts heart

    My dead hand plucked away

    Leave me an hour of rest  go thou
    And look from yonder heights

    Perchance the valley even now
    Is starred Avith city lights

    The henchman climbed the nearest hill

    He saw nor tower nor town
    But through the drear woods lone and still

    The river rolling down

    He heard the stealthy feet of things
    Whose shapes he could not see

    A flutter as of evil wings
    The fall of a dead tree

    The pines stood black against the moon

    A sword of fire beyond
    He heard the wolf howl and the loon

    Laugh from his reedy pond

    He turned him back   O master dear

    We are but men misled
    And thou hast sought a city here

    To find a grave instead

    As God shall will  what matters where
    A true mans cross may stand

    So Heaven be oer it here as there
    lu pleasant Norman land

    These woods perchance no secret hide

    Of lordly tower and hall
    Yon river in its wanderings wide

    Has washed no city wall

    Yet mirrored in the sullen stream

    The holy stars are given
    Is Norembega then a dream

    Whose waking is in Heaven

    No builded wonder of these lands
    My weary eyes shall see



    A city never made with hands
    Alone awaiteth me

    Urhs Syon mystica   I see

    Its mansions passing fair
    Condita ccelo   let me be

    Dear Lord a dweller there

    Above the dying exile hung

    The vision of the bard
    As faltered on bis failing tongue

    The song of good Bernard

    The henchman dug at dawn a grave

    Beneath the hemlocks brown
    And to the deserts keeping gave

    The lord of fief and town

    Years after when the Sieiir Champlain
    Sailed up the unknown stream

    And Norembega proved again
    A shadow and a dream

    He found the Normans nameless grave

    Within the hemlocks shade
    And stretching wide its arms to save

    The sign that God had made

    The crossboughed tree that marked the
    spot

    And made it holy ground
    He needs the earthly city not

    Who hath the heavenly found

    Knowing at last that it is not in man
    Who walketh to direct his steps or plan
    His permanent house of life Alike we

    loved
    The muses haunts and all our fancies

    moved
    To measures of old song How since that

    day
    Our feet have parted from the path that

    So fair before us  Rich from lifelong

    search
    Of truth within thy Academic porch
    Thou sittest now lord of a realm of fact
    Thy servitors the sciences exact
    Still listening  with thy hand on Natures

    keys
    To hear the Samiaus spheral harmonies
    And rhythm of law I called from dream

    and song
    Thank God  so early to a strife so long
    That ere it closed the black abundant

    hair
    Of boyhood rested silversown and spare
    On manhoods temples now at sunsetchime
    Tread with fond feet the path of morning

    time
    And if perchance too late I linger where
    The flowers have ceased to blow and trees

    are bare
    Thou wiser in thy choice wilt scarcely

    blame
    The friend who shields his folly with thy



    One Sabbath day my friend and I
    After the meeting quietly
    Passed from the crowded village lanes
    White with dry dust for lack of rains
    And climbed the neighboring slope with

    feet
    Slackened and heavy from the heat
    Although the day was wellnigh done
    And the low angle of the sun
    Along the naked hillside cast
    Our shadows as of giants vast
    We reached at length the topmost swell
    Whence eitlier way the green turf fell
    In terraces of nature down
    To fruithung orchards and the town
    With white pretenceless houses tall
    Churchsteeples and oershadowing all
    Huge mills whose windows had the look
    Of eager eyes that ill could brook



    The Sabbath rest We traced the track
    Of the seaseeking river back
    Glistening for miles above its mouth
    Through the long valley to the south
    And looking eastward cool to view
    Stretched the illimitable blue
    Of ocean from its curved coastline
    Sombred and still the warm sunshine
    Filled with pale golddust all the reach
    Of slumberous woods from hill to beach
    Slanted on walls of thronged retreats
    From city toil and dusty streets
    On grassy blufl and dune of sand
    And rocky islands miles from land
    Touched the farglancing sails and showed
    White lines of foam where long waves

    flowed
    Dumb in the distance In the north
    Dim through their misty hair looked forth
    The spacedwarfed mountains to the sea
    From mystery to mystery

    So sitting on that green hillslope
    We talked of human life its hope
    And fear and unsolved doubts and what
    It might have been and yet was not
    And when at last the evening air
    Grew sweeter for the bells of prayer
    Ringing in steeples far below
    We watched the people churchward go
    Each to his place as if thereon
    The true shekiuah only shone
    And my friend queried how it came
    To pass that they who owned the same
    Great Master still could not agree
    To worship Him in company
    Then broadening in his thought he ran
    Over the whole vast field of man
    The varying forms of faitli and creed
    That somehow served the holders need
    In which unquestioned undenied
    Uncounted millions lived and died
    The bibles of the ancient folk
    Through which the heart of nations spoke
    The old moralities which lent
    To home its sweetness and content
    And rendered possible to bear
    The life of peoples everywhere
    And asked if we who boast of light
    Claim not a too exclusive right
    To truths which must for all be meant
    Like rain and sunshine freely sent
    In bondage to the letter still
    We give it power to cramp and kill
    To tax Gods fulness with a scheme

    Narrower than Peters housetop dream

    His wisdom and his love with plans

    Poor and inadequate as mans

    It must be that He witnesses

    Somehow to all men that He is

    That something of His saving grace

    Reaches the lowest of the race

    Who tlirough strange creed and rite may

    diaw
    The hints of a diviner law
    We walk in clearer light   but then
    Is He not God   are they not men
    Are His responsibilities
    For us alone and not for these

    And I made answer   Truth is one
    And in all lands beneath the sun
    Whoso hath eyes to see may see
    Tlie tokens of its miity
    No scroll of creed its fidness wraps
    We trace it not by schoolboy maps
    Free as the sun and air it is
    Of latitudes and boundaries
    In Vedic verse in dull Kordn
    Are messages of good to man
    The angels to oiu Aryan sires
    Talked by the earliest household fires
    The prophets of the elder day
    The slanteyed sages of Cathay
    Read not the riddle all amiss
    Of higher life evolved from this

    Nor doth it lessen what He taught
    Or make the gospel Jesus broiight
    Less precious that His lips retold
    Some portion of that truth of old
    Denying not the proven seers
    The tested wisdom of the years
    Confirming with His own impress
    The common law of righteousness
    We search the world for truth  we

    cull
    The good the pure the beautiful
    From graven stone and written scroll
    From all old flowerfields of the soul
    And weary seekers of the best
    We come back laden from our quest
    To fuid that all the sages said
    Is in the Book our mothers read
    And all our treasure of old thought
    In His harmonious fulness wrought
    Who gathers in one sheaf complete
    The scattered blades of Gods sown wheat
    The common growth that maketh good
    His allembracing Fatherhood



    Wherever through the ages rise
    The altars of selfsacrifice
    Where love its arms has opened wide
    Or man for man has calmly died
    I see the same white wings outspread
    That hovered oer the Masters head
    Up from undated time they come
    The martyr souls of heathendom
    And to His cross and passion bring
    Their fellowship of suffering
    I trace His presence in the blind
    Pathetic gropings of my kind
    In prayers from sin and sorrow wrmig
    In cradlehymns of life they sung
    Each in its measure but a part
    Of the immeasured Overheart
    And with a stronger faith confess
    The greater that it owns the less
    Good cause it is for thankfulness
    That the worldblessing of His life
    With the long past is not at strife
    That the great marvel of His death
    To the one order witnesseth
    No doubt of changeless goodness wakes
    No link of cause and sequence breaks
    But one with nature rooted is
    In the eternal verities
    Whereby while differing m degree
    As finite from infinity
    The pain and loss for others borne
    Loves crown of suffering meekly worn
    The life man giveth for his friend
    Becomes vicarious in the end
    Their healing place in nature take
    And make life sweeter for their sake

    So welcome I from every source
    The tokens of that primal Force
    Older than heaven itself yet new
    As the young heart it reaches to
    Beneath whose steady impulse rolls
    The tidal wave of human souls
    Guide comforter and inward word
    The eternal spirit of the Lord
    Nor fear I aught that science brings
    From searching through material things
    Content to let its glasses prove
    Not by the letters oldness move
    The myriad worlds on worlds that course
    The spaces of the universe
    Since everywhere the Spirit walks
    Tlie garden of the heart and talks
    Witli man as under Edens trees
    In all his varied languages
    Why mourn above some hopeless flaw

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    In the stone tables of tlie law
    When scripture every day afresh
    Is traced on tablets of the flesh
    By inward sense by outward signs
    Gods presence still the heart divines
    Through deepest joy of Him we learn
    In sorest grief to Him we turn
    And reason stoops its pride to share
    The childlike instinct of a prayer

    And then as is my wont I told
    A story of the days of old
    Not found in printed books  in sooth
    A fancy with slight hint of truth
    Showing how differing faiths agree
    In one sweet law of charity
    Meanwhile the sky had golden grown
    Our faces in its glory shone
    But shadows down the valley swept
    And gray below the ocean slept
    As time and space I wandered oer
    To tread the Mogids marble floor
    And see a fairer sunset fall
    On Jumnas wave and Agras wall

    The good Shah Akbar peace be his alway
    Came forth from the Divan at close of day
    Bowed with the burden of his many cares
    Worn with the hearing of unnumbered

    prayers
    Wild cries for justice the importimate
    Appeals of greed and jealousy and hate
    And all the strife of sect and creed and rite
    Santon and Gouroo waging holy figlit
    For the wise monarch claiming not to be
    Allahs avenger left his people free
    With a faint hope his Book scarce justified
    That all the paths of faith though severed

    wide
    Oer which the feet of prayerful reverence

    passed
    Met at the gate of Paradise at last

    He sought an alcove of his cool hareem
    Where far beneath he heard the Jumnas

    stream
    Lapse soft and low along his palace wall
    And all about the cool sound of the fall
    Of fountains and of water circling free
    Through marble ducts along the balcony
    The voice of women in the distance sweet
    And sweeter still of one who at his feet
    Soothed his tired ear with songs of a far

    land
    Where Tagus shatters on the salt seasand



    The mirror of its corkgrown hills of drouth
    And vales of vine at Lisbons harbor
    mouth

    The datepalms rustled not  the peepul
    laid
    Its topmost boughs against the balustrade
    Motionless as the mimic leaves and vines
    That light and graceful as the shawl
    designs
    Of Delhi or Umritsir twined in stone
    And the tired monarch who aside had

    thrown
    The days hard burden sat from care apart
    And let the quiet steal into his heart
    From the still hour Below him Agra slept
    By the long light of sunset overswept
    The river flowing through a level land
    By mangogroves and banks of yellow sand
    Skirted with lime and orange gay kiosks
    Fountains at play tall minarets of mosques
    Fair pleasuregardens with their flowering

    trees
    Relieved against the mournful cypresses
    Aud airpoised lightly as the blown sea
    foam
    The marble wonder of some holy dome
    Hung a wliite moonrise over the still wood
    Glassing its beauty in a stiller flood

    Silent the monarch gazed until the night
    Swiftfalling hid the city from his sight
    Then to the woman at his feet he said
    Tell me O Miriam something thou hast

    read
    In childhood of the Master of thy faith
    Whom Islam also owns Our Prophet saith
    He was a true apostle yea a Word
    And Spirit sent before me from the Lord
    Thus the Book witnesseth  aud well I know
    By what thou art O dearest it is so
    As the lutes tone the makers hand be
    trays
    The sweet disciple speaks her Masters
    praise

    Then Miriam glad of heart for in some

    sort
    She cherished in the Moslems liberal court
    The sweet traditions of a Christian child
    And through her life of sense the mi

    defiled
    And chaste ideal of the sinless One
    Gazed on her with an eye she might not

    shun

    The sad reproacliful look of pity born
    Of love that hath no part in wrath or scorn
    Began with low voice and moist eyes to tell
    Of the allloving Christ and what befell
    When the fierce zealots thirsting for her

    blood
    Dragged to his feet a shame of womanhood
    How when liis searching answer pierced

    within
    Each heart and touched the secret of its sin
    And her accusers fled his face before
    He bade the poor one go and sin no more
    And Akbar said after a moments thought
    Wise is the lesson by thy prophet taught
    Woe unto him who judges and forgets
    What hidden evil his own heart besets
    Something of this large charity I find
    In all the sects that sever humankind
    I would to Allah that their lives agreed
    More nearly with the lesson of their creed
    Those yellow Lamas who at Meerut pray
    By wind and water power and love to say
    He who forgiveth not shall imf orgiven
    Fail of the rest of Buddha and who even
    Spare the black gnat that stings them vex

    my ears
    With the poor hates and jealbusies and fears
    Xursed in their human hives That lean

    fierce priest
    Of thy own people be his heart increased
    By Allahs love  his black robes smelling

    yet
    Of Goas roasted Jews have I not met
    Meekfaced barefooted crying in the street
    The saying of his prophet true and sweet
    He who is merciful shall mercy meet

    But next day so it chanced as night be
    gan
    To fall a murmur through the hareem ran
    Tliat one recalling in her dusky face
    The fulllipped mildeyed beauty of a race
    Known as the blameless Ethiops of Greek

    song
    Plotting to do her royal master wrong
    Watching reproachful of the lingering

    light
    The evening shadows deepen for her flight
    Lovegiuded to her home in a far land
    Now waited death at the great Shahs com
    mand

    Shapely as that dark princess for whose
    smile
    A world was bartered daughter of the Nile



    Herself and veiling in her large soft eyes
    The passion and the languor of her skies
    The Abyssmian knelt low at the feet
    Of her stern lord   O king if it be meet
    And for thy honors sake she said  that I
    Who am the humblest of thy slaves should

    die
    I will not tax thy mercy to forgive
    Easier it is to die than to outlive
    AU that life gave me  him whose wrong

    of thee
    Was but the outcome of his love for me
    Cherished from childhood when beneath

    the shade
    Of templed Axum side by side we played
    Stolen from his arms my lover followed me
    Through weary seasons over land and sea
    And two days since sitting disconsolate
    Within the shadow of the hareem gate
    Suddenly as if dropping from the sky
    Down from the lattice of the balcony
    Fell the sweet song by Tigres cowherds

    sung
    In the old music of his native tongue
    He knew my voice for love is quick of ear
    Answering in song

    This night he waited near
    To fly with me The fault was mine alone
    He knew thee not he did but seek his own
    Who in the very shadow of thy throne
    Sharing thy bounty knowing all thou art
    Greatest and best of men and in her heart
    Grateful to tears for favor undeserved
    Tuiued ever homeward nor one moment

    swerved
    From her young love He looked into my

    eyes
    He heard my voice aud could not otherwise
    Thau he hath done  yet save one wild em
    brace
    When first we stood together face to face
    And all that fate had done since last we met
    Seemed but a dream and left us children

    yet

    He hath not wronged thee nor thy royal bed
    Spare him O king  aud slay me in his
    stead

    But over Akbars brows the frown hung

    black
    And turning to the eunuch at his back
    Take them he said  and let the Jumnas

    waves
    Hide both my shame and these accursed

    slaves

    Straightway from a cloud
    Of dainty shawls and veils of woven mist
    The Christian Miriam rose and stooping

    The monarchs hand Loose down her

    shoidders bare
    Swept all the rippled darkness of her hair
    Veiling the bosom that with high quick

    Of fear and pity through it rose and fell

    Softened to her uplifted face that still

    Its pride and anger seemed like overblown
    Spent clouds of thunder left to tell alone
    Of strife and overcoming With bowed

    head
    And smiting on his bosom   God he said
    Alone is great and let His holy name
    Be honored even to His servants shame
    Well spake thy prophet Miriam  he alone
    Who hath not sinned is meet to cast a stone
    At such as these who here their doom

    await
    Held like myself in the strong grasp of

    fate
    They sinned through love as I through love

    forgive
    Take them beyond my realm but let them

    live

    And like a chorus to the words of grace
    The ancient Fakir sitting in his place
    Motionless as an idol and as grim
    In the pavilion Akbar built for him
    Under the courtyard trees  for he was
    wise



    Knew Menus laws and through his close
    shut eyes
    Saw things far off and as an open book
    Into the thoughts of other men could look
    Began half chant half howling to rehearse
    The fragment of a holy Vedic verse
    And thus it ran   He who all things for
    gives
    Conquers himself and all things else and

    lives
    Above the reach of wrong or hate or fear
    Calm as the gods to whom he is most dear

    Two leagues from Agra still the traveller
    sees
    The tomb of Akbar through its cypress
    trees
    And near at hand the marble walls that

    hide
    The Christian Begum sleeping at his side
    And oer her vault of burial who shall tell
    If it be chance alone or miracle
    The Mission press with tireless hand unrolls
    The words of Jesus on its lettered scrolls
    Tells in all tongues the tale of mercy oer
    And bids the guilty  Go and sin no more



    It now was dewfall  very still
    The night lay on the lonely hill
    Down wbich our homeward steps we bent
    And silent through great silence went
    Save that the tireless crickets played
    Their long monotonous serenade
    A yoimg moon at its narrowest
    Curved sharp against the darkening west
    And momently the beacons star
    Slow wheeling oer its rock afar
    From out the level darkness shot
    One instant and again was not
    And then my friend spake quietly
    The thought of both   Yon crescent see
    Like Islams symbolmoon it gives
    Hints of the light whereby it lives
    Somewhat of goodness something true
    From sun and spirit shining through
    All faiths all worlds as through the dark
    Of ocean shines the lighthouse spark
    Attests the presence everywhere
    Of love and providential care
    The faith the old Norse heart confessed
    In one dear name  the hopefulest
    And tenderest heard from mortal lips
    In pangs of birth or death from ships



    NAUHAUGHT THE DEACON



    99



    Icebitten in the winter sea
    Or lisped beside a mothers knee
    The wiser world hath not outgrown
    And the AllFather is our own



    NAUHAUGHT THE DEACON

    Nauhaught the Indian deacon who of old
    Dwelt poor but blameless where his nar
    rowing Cape
    Stretches its shrunk arm out to all the winds
    And the relentless smiting of the waves
    Awoke one morning from a pleasant dream
    Of a good angel dropping in his hand
    A fair broad goldpiece in the name of God

    He rose and went forth with the early day
    Far inland where the voices of the waves
    Mellowed and mingled with the whispering

    leaves
    As through the tangle of the low thick

    woods
    He searched his traps Therein nor beast

    nor bird
    He foimd  though meanwhile in the reedy

    pools
    The otter plashed and imderneath the pines
    The partridge drummed  and as his

    thoughts went back
    To the sick wife and little child at home
    What marvel that the poor man felt his faith
    Too weak to bear its burden  like a rope
    That strand by strand uncoiling breaks

    above
    The hand that grasps it  Even now O

    Lord
    Send me he prayed  the angel of my

    dream
    Nauhaught is very poor  he camiot wait

    Even as he spake he heard at his bare feet
    A low metallic clink and looking down
    He saw a dainty purse with disks of gold
    Crowding its silken net Awhile he held
    The treasure up before his ejes alone
    With his great need feeling the wondrous

    coins
    Slide through his eager fingers one by one
    So then the dream was true The angel

    brought
    One broad piece only  should he take all

    these
    Who would be wiser in the blind dumb

    woods



    The loser doubtless rich would scarcely

    miss
    This dropped crumb from a table always

    full
    Still while he mused he seemed to hear

    the cry
    Of a starved child  the sick face of his Avife
    Tempted him Heart and flesh in fierce

    revolt
    Urged the wild license of his savage youth
    Against his later scruples Bitter toil
    Prayer fasting dread of blame and pitiless

    eyes
    To watch his haltmg  had he lost for

    these
    The freedom of the woods   the hunting

    groimds
    Of happy spirits for a walledin heaven
    Of everlasting psalms  One healed the sick
    Very far off thousands of moons ago
    Had he not prayed him night and day to

    come
    And cure his bedbound wife  Was there

    a hell
    Were all his fathers people writhing

    there
    Like the poor shellfish set to boil alive
    Forever dying never  If he kept
    This gold so needed would the dreadful

    God
    Torment him like a Mohawks captive

    stuck
    With slowconsuming splinters  Would

    the saints
    And the wliite angels dance and laugh to

    see him
    Burn like a pitchpine torch  His Chris
    tian garb
    Seemed falling from him  with the fear

    and shame
    Of Adam naked at the cool of day
    He gazed around A black snake lay in coil
    On the hot sand a crow with sidelong eye
    Watched from a dead bough All his In
    dian lore
    Of evil blending with a converts faith
    In the supernal terrors of the Book
    He saw the Tempter in the coiling snake
    And ominous blackwinged bird  and all

    the while
    The low rebuking of the distant waves
    Stole in upon him like the voice of God
    Among the trees of Eden Girding up
    His souls loins with a resolute hand he
    thrust



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    The base thought from him   Nauhaught

    be a man
    Starve if need be  but while you live look

    out
    From honest eyes on all men unashamed
    God help me  I am deacon of the church
    A baptized praying Indian  Should I do
    This secret meanness even the barken

    knots
    Of the old trees would turn to eyes to see

    it
    The birds would tell of it and all the leaves
    Whisper above me   Nauhaught is a

    thief
    The sun would know it and the stars that

    hide
    Behind his light would watch me and at

    night
    Follow me with their sharp accusing eyes
    Yea thou God seest me   Then Nau
    haught drew
    Closer his belt of leather dulling thus
    The pain of hunger and walked bravely

    back
    To the brown fishinghamlet by the sea
    And pausing at the inn  door cheerily

    asked
    Who hath lost aught today

    I said a voice
    Ten golden pieces in a silken purse
    My daughters handiwork He looked

    and lo
    One stood before him in a coat of frieze
    And the glazed hat of a seafaring man
    Shrewdfaced broadshouldered with no

    trace of wings
    Marvelling he dropped within the stran
    gers hand
    The silken web and turned to go his way
    But the man said   A tithe at least is

    yours
    Take it in Gods name as an honest man
    And as the deacons dusky fingers closed
    Over the golden gift  Yea in Gods name
    I take it with a poor mans thanks he

    said
    So down the street that like a river of

    sand
    Ran white in sunshine to the summer sea
    He sought his home singing and praising

    God
    And when his neighbors in their careless

    way
    Spoke of the owner of the silken purse
    A Wellfleet skipper known in every port



    That the Cape opens in its sandy wall
    He answered with a wise smile to him
    self
    I saw the angel where they see a man

    THE SISTERS

    Annie and Rhoda sisters twain
    Woke in the night to the sound of rain

    The rush of wind the ramp and roar
    Of great waves climbing a rocky shore

    Amiie rose up in her bedgown white
    And looked out into the storm and night

    Hush and hearken   she cried in fear
    Hearest thou nothing sister dear

    I hear the sea and the plash of rain
    And roar of the northeast hurricane

    Get thee back to the bed so warm
    No good comes of watching a storm

    What is it to thee I fain would know
    That waves are roaring and wUd winds
    blow

    No lover of thine s afloat to miss
    The harborlights on a night like this

    But I heard a voice cry out my name
    Up from the sea on the wind it came

    Twice and thrice have I heard it call
    And the voice is the voice of Estwick
    Hall

    On her pillow the sister tossed her head
    Hall of the Heron is safe she said

    In the tautest schooner that ever swam
    He rides at anchor in Annisquam

    And if Ln peril from swamping sea

    Or lee shore rocks would he call on thee

    But the girl heard only the vsdnd and tide
    And wringing her small white hands she
    cried

    O sister Rhoda there s something wrong
    I hear it again so loud and long



    MARGUERITE



    Annie  Annie   I hear it call
    And the voice is the voice of Estwick
    Hall

    Up sprang the elder with eyes aflame
    Thou liest  He never would call thy
    name

    If he did I would pray the wind and

    sea
    To keep him forever from thee and me

    Then out of the sea blew a dreadfid

    blast
    Like the cry of a dying man it passed

    The young girl hushed on her lips a groan
    But through her tears a strange light
    shone

    The solemn joy of her hearts release
    To own and cherish its love in peace

    Dearest   she whispered imder breath
    Life was a lie but true is death

    The love I hid from myself away
    Shall crown me now in the light of day

    My ears shall never to wooer list
    Never by lover my lips be kissed

    Sacred to thee am I henceforth
    Thou in heaven and I on earth

    She came and stood by her sisters bed
    Hall of the Heron is dead   she said

    The wind and the waves their work have

    done
    We shall see him no more beneath the

    sun

    Little will reck that heart of thine
    It loved him not with a love like mine

    I for his sake were he but here
    Could hem and broider thy bridal gear

    Though hands should tremble and eyes

    be wet
    And stitch for stitch in my heart be set

    But now my soul with his soul I wed
    Thine the living and mine the dead

    MASSACHUSETTS BAY 1760

    Upwards of one thousand of the Acadian
    peasants forcibly taken from theii homes on
    the Gaspereaii and Basin of Minas were as
    signed to the several towns of the Massachu
    setts colony the children being bound by the
    authorities to service or labor

    The robins sang in the orchard the buds

    into blossoms grew
    Little of human sorrow the buds and the

    robins knew

    Sick in an alien household the poor French

    neutral lay
    Into her lonesome garret fell the light of

    the April day

    Through the dusty window curtained by
    the spiders warp and woof

    On the looselaid floor of hemlock on
    oaken ribs of roof

    The bedquilts faded patchwork the tea
    cups on the stand

    The wheel with flaxen tangle as it dropped
    from her sick hand

    What to her was the song of the robin or
    warm morning light

    As she lay in the trance of the dying heed
    less of sound or sight

    Done was the work of her hands she had

    eaten her bitter bread
    The world of the alien people lay behind

    her dim and dead

    But her soul went back to its childtime

    she saw the sun oerflow
    With gold the Basin of Minas and set over

    Gaspereau

    The low bare flats at ebbtide the rush of

    the sea at flood
    Through inlet and creek and river from

    dike to upland wood

    The gulls in the red of morning the fish
    hawks rise and fall

    dark coastwall

    She saw the face of her mother she heard

    the song she sang
    And far off faintly slowly the bell for

    vespers rang

    By her bed the hardfaced mistress sat
    smoothing the wrinkled sheet

    Peering into the face so helpless and feel
    ing the icecold feet

    With a vague remorse atoning for her greed

    and long abuse
    By care no longer heeded and pity too late
    for use

    Up the stairs of the garret softly the son of

    the mistress stepped
    Leaned over the headboard covering his

    face with his hands and wept

    Outspake the mother who watched him
    sharply with brow afrown

    What  love you the Papist the beggar
    the charge of the town

    Be she Papist or beggar who lies here I

    know and God knows
    I love her and fain would go with her

    wherever she goes

    O mother  that sweet face came pleading

    for love so athirst
    You saw but the towncharge  I knew her

    Gods angel at first

    Shaking her gray head the mistress hushed

    down a bitter cry
    And awed by the silence and shadow of

    death drawing nigh

    She murmured a psalm of the Bible  but
    closer the young girl pressed

    With the last of her life in her fingers the
    cross to her breast

    My son come away cried the mother

    her voice cruel grown
    She is joined to her idols like Ephraim

    let her alone

    But he knelt with his hand on her forehead

    his lips to her ear
    And he called back the soul that was

    passing   Marguerite do you

    hear



    She paused on the threshold of heaven

    love pity surjjrise
    Wistful tender lit up for an instant the

    cloud of her eyes

    With his heart on his lips he kissed her
    but never her cheek grew red

    And the words the living long for he spake
    in the ear of the dead

    And the robins sang in the orchard where

    buds to blossoms grew
    Of the folded hands and the still face never

    the robins knew



    THE ROBIN

    My old Welsh neighbor over the way
    Crept slowly out in the sun of spring

    Pushed from her ears the locks of gray
    And listened to hear the robins sing

    Her grandson playing at marbles stopped
    And cruel in sport as boys will be

    Tossed a stone at the bird who hopped
    From bough to bough in the appletree

    Nay   said the grandmother   have you
    not heard

    My poor bad boy  of the fiery pit
    And how drop by drop this merciful bird

    Carries the water that quenches it

    He brings cool dew in his little bill
    And lets it fall on the souls of sin

    You can see the naark on his red breast still
    Of fires that scorch as he drops it in

    My poor Bron rhuddyn  my breast
    burned biid

    Singing so sweetly from limb to limb
    Very dear to the heart of Our Lord

    Is he who pities the lost like Him

    Amen   I said to the beautiful myth

    Sing bird of God in my heart as well
    Each good thought is a drop wherewith

    To cool and lessen the fires of hell

    Prayers of love like raindrops fall
    Tears of pity are cooling dew

    And dear to the heart of Our Lord are all
    Who suffer like Him in the good they
    do

    THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM

    For the preface which introduced this poem
    when first piiblislied see the notes at the end
    of this volume The verses which precede the
    prehxde are from the Latin of Francis Daniel
    Pastorius in the Germantown Records 1688

    Hail to posterity
    Hail future men of Germanopolis

    Let the young generations yet to be
    Look kindly upon this
    Think bow your fathers left their native
    land
    Dear Germanland  O sacred hearths

    and homes
    And where the wild beast roams
    In patience planned
    New foresthomes beyond the mighty sea

    There undisturbed and free
    To live as brothers of one family
    What pains and caies befell
    What trials and what fears
    Remember and wherein we have done well
    Follow our footsteps men of coming
    years
    Where we have failed to do
    Aright or wisely live
    Be warned by us the better way pursue
    And knowing we were human even as you
    Pity us and forgive
    Farewell Posterity
    Farewell dear German
    Forevermore farewell

    PRELUDE

    I SING the Pilgrim of a softer clime

    And milder speech than those brave mens
    who brought
    To the ice and iron of our winter time
    A will as firm a creed as stern and

    wrought
    With one mailed hand and with the other
    fought
    Simply as tits my theme in homely rhyme
    I sing tlie blueeyed German Spener
    tauglit
    Through whose veiled mystic faith the In
    ward Light
    Steady and still an easy brightness
    shone
    Transfiguring all things in its radiance
    white



    The garland which his meekness never
    sought
    I bring him  over fields of harvest sown
    With seeds of blessing now to ripeness
    grown
    I bid the sower pass before the reapers
    sight



    Never in tenderer quiet lapsed the day
    From Pennsylvanias vales of spring away
    Where forestwalled the scattered hamlets
    lay

    Along the wedded rivers One long bar
    Of purple cloud on which the evening

    star
    Shone like a jewel on a scimitar

    Held the skys golden gateway Through

    the deep
    Hush of the woods a murmur seemed to

    creep
    The Schuylkill whispering in a voice of

    sleep

    All else was stiU The oxen from their
    ploughs

    Rested at last and from their long days
    browse

    Came the dun files of Krisheims home
    bound cows

    And the young city round whose virgin

    zone
    The rivers like two mighty arms were

    thrown
    Marked by the smoke of evening fires

    alone

    Lay in the distance lovely even then
    With its fair women and its stately men
    Gracing the forest court of William Penn

    Urban yet sylvan  in its rough  hewn

    frames
    Of oak and pine the dryads held their

    claims
    And lent its streets their pleasant woodland

    names

    Anna Pastorius down the leafy lane
    Looked cityward then stooped to prune

    again
    Her vines and simples with a sigh of pain

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    For fast the streaks of ruddy sunset paled
    In the oak clearing and as daylight failed
    Slow overhead the dusky nightbirds
    sailed

    Again she looked  between green walls of

    shade
    With low bent head as if with sorrow

    weighed
    Daniel Pastorius slowly came and said

    Gods peace be with thee Anna   Then

    he stood
    Silent before her wrestling with the mood
    Of one who sees the evil and not good

    What is it my Pastorius   As she spoke
    A slow faint smile across his features broke
    Sadder than tears  Dear heart he said
    our folk

    Are even as others Yea our goodliest

    Friends
    Are frail  our elders have their selfish ends
    And few dare trust the Lord to make

    amends

    For dutys loss So even our feeble word
    For the dumb slaves the startled meeting

    heard
    As if a stone its quiet waters stirred

    And as the clerk ceased reading there

    began
    A ripple of dissent which downward ran
    In widening circles as from man to man

    Somewhat was said of running before
    sent

    Of tender fear that some their guide out
    went

    Troublers of Israel I was scarce intent

    On hearing for behind the reverend row
    Of gallery Friends in dumb and piteous

    show
    I saw methought dark faces full of woe

    And in the spirit I was taken where
    They toiled and suffered  I was made aware
    Of shame and wrath and anguish and de
    spair

    And while the meeting smothered our
    poor plea



    With cautious phrase a Voice there seemed

    to be
    As ye have done to these ye do to me

    So it all passed  and the old tithe went on
    Of anise mint and cumin till the sun
    Set leaving still the weightier work un
    done

    Help for the good man faileth  Who is

    strong
    If these be weak  Who shall rebuke the

    wrong
    If these consent  How long O Lord

    how long

    He ceased  and bound in spirit with the

    bound
    With folded arms and eyes that sought the

    ground
    Walked musingly his little garden round

    About him beaded with the falling dew
    Rare plants of power and herbs of healing

    grew
    Such as Van Helmont and Agrippa knew

    For by the lore of Gorlitz gentle sage
    With the mild mystics of his dreamy age
    He read the herbal signs of natures page

    As once he heard in sweet Von Merlaus

    bowers
    Fair as herself in boyhoods happy hours
    The pious Spener read his creed in flowers

    The dear Lord give us patience   said

    his wife
    Touching with fingertip an aloe rife
    With leaves sharppointed like an Aztec

    knife

    Or Carib spear a gift to William Penn
    From the rare gardens of John Evelyn
    Brought from the Spanish Main by mer
    chantmen

    See this strange plant its steady purpose

    hold
    And year by year its patient leaves unfold
    Till the young eyes that watched it first are

    old

    But some time thou hast told me there
    shall come



    THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM



    105



    A sudden beauty brightness and perfume
    The centurymoulded bud shall burst in
    bloom

    So may the seed which hath been sown

    today
    Grow with tJie years and after long delay
    Break into bloom aud Gods eternal Yea

    Answer at last the patient prayers of them
    Who now by faith aloue behold its stem
    Crowned with the flowers of Freedoms
    diadem

    Meanwhile to feel and suffer work and

    wait
    Remains for us The wrong indeed is

    great
    But love and patience conquer soon or late

    Well hast thou said my Anna   Ten
    derer
    Than youths caress upon the head of her
    Pastorius laid his hand  Shall we demur

    Because the vision tarrieth  In an hour
    We dream not of the slowgrown bud may

    flower
    And what was sown in weakness rise in

    power

    Then through the vinedraped door whose

    legend read
    Procul este profani   Anna led
    To where their child upon his little bed

    Looked up and smiled  Dear heart she

    said  if we
    Must bearers of a heavy burden be
    Our boy God willing yet the day shall see

    When from the gallery to the farthest seat
    Slave and slaveowner shall no longer meet
    But all sit equal at the Masters feet

    On the stone hearth the blazing walnut block
    Set the low walls aglimmer showed the

    cock
    Rebuking Peter on the Van Wyck clock

    Shone on old tomes of law and physic side
    By side with Fox and Behmen played at

    hide
    And seek with Anna midst her household

    pride



    Of flaxen webs and on the table bare
    Of costly cloth or silver cup but where
    Tasting the fat shads of the Delaware

    The courtly Penn had praised the good
    wifes cheer

    Aud quoted Horace oer her homebrewed
    beer

    Till even grave Pastorius smiled to hear

    In such a home beside the Schuylkills

    wave
    He dwelt in peace with God and man aud

    gave
    Food to the poor and shelter to the slave

    For all too soou the New Worlds scandal

    shamed
    The righteous code by Penn and Sidney

    framed
    And men withheld the human rights they

    claimed

    And slowly wealth and station sanction lent
    And hardened avarice on its gains intent
    Stifled the inward whisper of dissent

    Yet all the while the burden rested sore
    On tender hearts At last Pastorius bore
    Their warning message to the Churchs
    door

    In Gods name  and the leaven of the word
    Wrought ever after in the souls who heard
    And a dead conscience in its graveclothes
    stirred

    To troubled life and urged the vain excuse
    Of Hebrew custom patriarchal use
    Good in itself if evil in abuse

    Gravely Pastorius listened not the less
    Discerning through the decent figleaf dress
    Of the poor plea its shame of selfishness

    One Scripture rule at least was unforgot
    He hid the outcast and bewrayed him not
    And when his prey the human hunter
    sought

    He scrupled not while Annas wise delay
    And proffered cheer prolonged the masters

    stay
    To speed the black guest safely on his

    way

    Yet who shall guess his bitter grief who

    lends
    His life to some great cause and finds his

    friends
    Shame or betray it for their private ends

    How felt the Master when his chosen strove
    In childish folly for their seats above
    And that fond mother blinded by her love

    Besought him that her sons beside his

    throne
    Might sit on either hand  Amidst his own
    A stranger oft companionless and lone

    Gods priest and prophet stands The

    martyrs pain
    Is not alone from scourge and cell and

    chain
    Sharper the pang when shouting in his

    train

    His weak disciples by their lives deny
    The loud hosannas of their daily cry
    And make their echo of his truth a lie

    His forest home no hermits cell he found
    Guests motleyminded drew his hearth

    around
    And held armed truce upon its neutral

    ground

    There Indian chiefs with battlebows un

    Strong herolimbed like those whom Ho

    Pastorius fancied when the world was
    young

    Came with their tawny women lithe and

    tall
    Like bronzes in his friend Von Rodecks

    Weak timid homesick slow to imderstand
    The New Worlds promise sought his help

    Or painful Kelpius from his hermit den
    By Wissahickon maddest of good men
    Dreamed oer the ChUiast dreams of Peter
    sen

    Deep in the woods where the small river

    slid
    Snakelike in shade the Helnistadt Mystic

    hid
    Weird as a wizard over arts forbid

    Reading the books of Daniel and of John
    And Behmens MorningRedness through

    the Stone
    Of Wisdom vouchsafed to his eyes alone

    Whereby he read what man neer read be
    fore
    And saw the visions man shall see no more
    Till the great angel striding sea and shore

    Shall bid all flesh await on land or ships
    The warning trump of the Apocalypse
    Shattering the heavens before the dread

    Or meekeyed Mennonist his bearded chin
    Leaned oer the gate  or Ranter pure

    And dance of flame as if they fain would

    cheer
    The rugged face half tender half austere
    Touched with the pathos of a homesick

    tear

    Or Sluyter saintly familist whose word
    As law the Brethren of the Manor heard
    Announced the speedy terrors of the Lord

    And turned like Lot at Sodom from his

    THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM



    107



    Manly in tbouglit in simple ways a child
    His white hair floating round his visage
    mild

    The Swedish pastor sought the Quakers

    door
    Pleased from his neighbors lips to hear

    once more
    His longdisused and halfforgotten lore

    For both could baffle Babels lingual curse
    And speak in Bions Doric and rehearse
    Cleanthes hymu or Virgils somiding verse

    And oft Pastorius and the meek old man
    Argued as Quaker and as Lutheran
    Ending in Christian love as they began

    With lettered Lloyd on pleasant morns he

    strayed
    Where Sommerhausen over vales of shade
    Looked miles away by every flower de
    layed

    Or song of bird happy and free with one
    Who loved like him to let his memory run
    Over old fields of learning and to sun

    Himself in Platos wise philosophies
    And dream with Philo over mysteries
    Whereof the dreamer never finds the keys

    To touch all themes of thought nor weakly

    stop
    For doubt of truth but let the buckets drop
    Deep down and bring the hidden waters

    up

    For there was freedom in that wakening

    time
    Of tender souls  to differ was not crime
    The varying bells made up the perfect

    chime

    On lips unlike was laid the altars coal
    The white clear light traditioncolored

    stole
    Through the stained oriel of each human

    soul

    Gathered from many sects the Quaker

    brought
    His old beliefs adjusting to the thought
    That moved his soul the creed his fathers

    taught



    One faith alone so broad that all mankind
    Within themselves its secret witness find
    The souls commimion with the Eternal
    Mind

    The Spirits law the Inward Rule and

    Guide
    Scholar and peasant lord and serf allied
    The polished Penn and Cromwells Ironside

    As still in Hemskercks Quaker Meeting

    face
    By face in Flemish detail we may trace
    How loosemouthed boor and fine ancestral

    grace

    Sat in close contrast  the cliptheaded
    churl

    Broad marketdame and simple serving
    girl

    By skirt of silk and periwig in curl

    For soul touched soul  the spiritual treas
    uretrove
    Made all men equal none coidd rise above
    Nor sink below that level of Gods love

    So with his rustic neighbors sitting down
    The homespun frock beside the scholars

    gown
    Pastorius to the manners of the town

    Added the freedom of the woods and

    sought
    The bookless wisdom by experience taught
    And learned to love his newfound home

    while not

    Forgetful of the old  the seasons went
    Their roimds and somewhat to his spirit

    lent
    Of their own calm and measureless content

    Glad even to tears he heard the robin sing
    His song of welcome to the Western spring
    And bluebird borrowing from the sky his
    wing

    And when the miracle of autumn came
    And all the woods with manycolored flame

    Spake to him from each kindled bush

    around
    And made the strange new landscape holy

    ground

    And when the bitter northwind keen and
    swift

    Swept the white street and piled the door
    yard drift

    He exercised as Friends might say his gift

    Of verse Dutch English Latin like the

    hash
    Of corn and beans in Indian succotash
    Dull doubtless but with here and there a

    flash

    Of wit and fine conceit  the good mans

    play
    Of quiet fancies meet to while away
    The slow hours measuring off an idle day

    At evening while his wife put on her look
    Of loves endurance from its niche he

    took
    The written pages of his ponderous book

    And read in half the languages of man
    His  Rusca Apium which with bees be
    gan
    And through the gamut of creation ran

    Or now and then the missive of some friend
    In gray Altorf or storied Niirnberg penned
    Dropped in upon him like a guest to spend

    The night beneath his rooftree Mystical
    The fair Von Merlau spake as waters fall
    And voices sound in dreams and yet withal

    Hmnan and sweet as if each far low tone
    Over the roses of her gardens blown
    Brought the warm sense of beauty all her
    own

    Wise Spener questioned what his friend

    could trace
    Of spiritual influx or of saving grace
    In the wild natures of the Indian race

    And learned Schurmberg fain at times to
    look

    From Talmud Koran Veds and Penta
    teuch

    Sought out his pupil in his faroff nook



    To query with him of climatic change
    Of bird beast reptile in Iiis forest range
    Of flowers and fruits and simples new and
    strange

    And thus the Old and New World reached

    their hands
    Across the water and the friendly lands
    Talked with each other from their severed

    strands

    Pastorius answered all  while seed and root
    Sent from his new home grew to flower and

    fruit
    Along the Rhine and at the Spessarts foot

    And in return the flowers his boyhood knew
    Smiled at his door the same in form and

    hue
    And on his vines the Rhenish clusters grew

    No idler he  whoever else might shirk
    He set his hand to every honest work
    Farmer and teacher court and meeting
    clerk

    Still on the town seal his device is found
    Grapes flax and threadspool on a trefoil

    ground
    With Vinum Linum et Textrinum

    wound

    One house sufficed for gospel and for law
    Where Paul and Grotius Scripture text and

    saw
    Assured the good and held the rest in awe

    Whatever legal maze he wandered through
    He kept the Sermon on the Moimt in view
    And justice always into mercy grew

    No whippingpost he needed stocks nor

    jail
    Nor duckingstool  the orchardthief grew

    pale
    At his rebuke the vixen ceased to rail

    The usurers grasp released the forfeit land
    The slanderer faltered at the witnessstand
    And all men took his counsel for command

    Was it caressing air the brooding love
    Of tenderer skies than German land knew

    of
    Green calm below blue quietness above

    Still flow of water deep repose of wood
    That with a sense of loving Fatherhood
    And childlike trust in the Eternal Good

    Softened all hearts and dulled the edge of

    hate
    Hushed strife and taught impatient zeal to

    wait
    The slow assurance of the better state

    Who knows what goadings in their sterner

    way
    Oer jagged ice relieved by granite gray
    Blew round the men of Massachusetts Bay

    What hate of heresy the eastwind woke
    What hints of pitiless power and terror

    spoke
    In waves that on their iron coastline broke

    Be it as it may  within the Land of Penn

    The sectary yielded to the citizen

    And peaceful dwelt the manycreeded men

    Peace brooded over all No trumpet stung
    The air to madness and no steeple flung
    Alarums down from bells at micbiight rmig

    The land slept well The Indian from his

    face
    Washed all his warpaint off and in the

    place
    Of battlemarches sped the peaceful chase

    Or wrought for wages at the white mans

    side
    Giving to kindness what his native pride
    And lazy freedom to all else denied

    And well the curious scholar loved the

    old
    Traditions that his swarthy neighbors

    told
    By wigwamfires when nights were growing

    cold

    Discerned the fact round which their fancy

    drew
    Its dreams and held their childish faith

    more true
    To God and man than half the creeds he

    knew

    The desert blossomed round him  wheat
    fields rolled



    Beneath the warm wind waves of green

    and gold
    The planted ear returned its hundredfold

    Great clusters ripened in a warmer sun
    Than that which by the Rhine stream shines

    upon
    The purpling hillsides with low vines oer

    run

    About each rustic porch the hummingbird
    Tried with light bill that scarce a petal

    stirred
    The Old World flowers to virgin soil trans
    ferred

    And the firstfruits of pear and apple
    bending

    The young boughs down their gold and
    russet blending

    Made glad his heart familiar odors lend
    ing

    To the fresh fragrance of the birch and

    pine
    Lifeeverlasting bay and eglantine
    And all the subtle scents the woods combine

    Fair FirstDay mornings steeped in sum
    mer calm

    Warm tender restful sweet with woodland
    balm

    Came to him like some motherhallowed
    psalm

    To the tired grinder at the noisy wheel
    Of labor winding off from memorys reel
    A golden thread of music With no peal

    Of bells to call them to the house of
    praise

    The scattered settlers through green forest
    ways

    Walked meeting ward In reverent amaze

    The Indian trapper saw them from the

    dim
    Shade of the alders on the rivulets rim
    Seek the Great Spirits house to talk with

    Him

    There through the gathered stillness mul
    tiplied
    And made intense by sympathy outside
    The sparrows sang and the goldrobin cried

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Aswing upon his elm A faint perfume
    Breathed through the open windows of the

    room
    From locusttrees heavy with clustered

    bloom

    Thither perchance soretried confessors

    came
    Whose fervor jail nor pillory could tame
    Proud of the cropped ears meant to be their

    shame

    Men who had eaten slaverys bitter bread
    In Indian isles  pale women who had bled
    Under the hangmans lash and bravely
    said

    Gods message through their prisons iron

    bars
    And gray old soldierconverts seamed with

    scars
    From every stricken field of Englands wars

    Lowly before the Unseen Presence knelt
    Each waiting heart till haply some one felt
    On his moved lips the seal of silence melt

    Or without spoken words low breathings

    stole
    Of a diviner life from soul to soul
    Baptizing in one tender thought the whole

    When shaken hands announced the meeting

    oer
    The friendly group still lingered at the door
    Greeting inquiring sharing all the store

    Of weekly tidings Meanwhile youth and
    maid

    Down the green vistas of the woodland
    strayed

    Whispered and smiled and oft their feet de
    layed

    Did the boys whistle answer back the

    thrushes
    Did light girl laughter ripple through the

    bushes
    As brooks make merry over roots and

    rushes

    Unvexed the sweet air seemed Without a

    wound
    The ear of silence heard and every sound
    Its place in natures fine accordance found



    And solemn meeting summer sky and wood
    Old kindly faces youth and maidenhood
    Seemed like Gods new creation very good

    And greeting all with quiet smile and word
    Pastorius went his way The unscared bird
    Sang at his side  scarcely the squirrel
    stirred

    At his hushed footstep on the mossy sod
    And wheresoeer the good man looked or

    trod
    He felt the peace of nature and of God

    His social life wore no ascetic form

    He loved all beauty without fear of harm

    And in his veins his Teuton blood ran warm

    Strict to himself of other men no spy
    He made his own no circuitjudge to try
    The freer conscience of his neighbors by

    With love rebuking by his life alone
    Gracious and sweet the better way was

    shown
    The joy of one who seeking not his own

    And faithful to all scruples finds at last
    The thorns and shards of duty overpast
    And daily life beyond his hopes forecast

    Pleasant and beautiful with sight and sound
    And flowers upspringing in its narrow

    round
    And all his days with quiet gladness

    crowned

    He sang not  but if sometimes tempted

    strong
    He hummed what seemed like Altorfs

    Burschensong
    His good wife smiled and did not count it

    wrong

    For well he loved his boyhoods brother

    band
    His Memory while he trod the New Worlds

    strand
    A doubleganger walked the Fatherland

    If when on frosty Christmas eves the light
    Shone on his quiet hearth he missed the

    THE PENNSYLVANIA PILGRIM



    III



    And closed his eyes and listened to the

    sweet
    Old waitsongs sounding down his native

    street
    And watched again the dancers mingling

    feet

    Yet not the less when once the vision passed
    He held the plain and sober maxims fast
    Of the dear Friends with whom his lot was

    cast

    Still all attuned to natures melodies

    He loved the birds song in his dooryard

    trees
    And the low hum of homereturning bees

    The blossomed flax the tuliptrees in bloom
    Down the long street the beauty and per
    fume
    Of appleboughs the mingling light and
    gloom

    Of Sommerhausens woodlands woven
    through

    With sunthreads  and the music the wind
    drew

    Mournful and sweet from leaves it over
    blew

    And evermore beneath this outward sense
    And through the common sequence of

    events
    He felt the guiding hand of Providence

    Reach out of space A Voice spake in his

    ear
    And lo  all other voices far and near
    Died at that whisper full of meanings clear

    The Light of Life shone roimd him  one by

    one
    The wandering lights that allmisleading

    run
    Went out like candles paling in the sun

    That Light he followed step by step

    whereer
    It led as in the vision of the seer
    The wheels moved as the spirit in the clear

    And terrible crystal moved with all their

    eyes
    Watching the living splendor sink or rise
    Its will their will knowing no otherwise



    Within himself he fomid the law of right
    He walked by faith and not the letters

    sight
    And read his Bible by the Inward Light

    And if sometimes the slaves of form and

    rule
    Frozen in their creeds like fish in winters

    pool
    Tried the large tolerance of his liberal

    school

    His door was free to men of every name
    He welcomed all the seeking soids who

    came
    And no mans faith he made a cause of

    blame

    But best he loved in leisure hours to see
    His own dear Friends sit by him knee to

    knee
    In social converse genial frank and free

    There sometimes silence it were hard to

    tell
    Who owned it first vipon the circle fell
    Hushed Annas busy wheel and laid its spell

    On the black boy who grimaced by the

    hearth
    To solemnize his shining face of mirth
    Only the old clock ticked amidst the dearth

    Of sound  nor eye was raised nor hand

    was stirred
    In that soulsabbath till at last some word
    Of tender counsel or low prayer was heard

    Then guests who lingered but farewell to
    say

    And take loves message went their home
    ward way

    So passed in peace the guileless Quakers
    day

    His was the Christians unsung Age of

    Gold
    A truer idyl than the bards have told
    Of Arnos banks or Arcady of old

    Where still the Friends their place of

    burial keep
    And centuryrooted mosses oer it creep
    The Niirnberg scholar and his helpmeet

    KING VOLMER AND ELSIE

    AFTER THE DANISH OF CHRISTIAN
    WINTER

    A Danish gentleman Mr P Taft sent the
    IJoet an unrhymed outline in English of Win
    ters ballad

    Where over heathen doomrings and gray

    stones of the Horg
    In its little Christian city stands the church

    of Vordingborg



    In merry mood King Volmer sat forgetful

    of his power
    As idle as the Goose of Gold that brooded

    on his tower

    Out spake the King to Henrik his young

    and faithful squire
    Darst trust thy little Elsie the maid of

    thy desire
    Of all the men in Denmark she loveth

    only me
    As true to me is Elsie as thy Lily is to

    thee

    Loud laughed the king   Tomorrow shall

    bring another day
    When I myself will test her  she will not

    say me nay
    Thereat the lords and gallants that round

    about him stood
    Wagged all their heads in concert and

    smiled as courtiers should

    The gray lark sings oer Vordingborg and

    on the ancient town
    From the tall tower of Valdemar the

    Golden Goose looks down
    The yellow grain is waving in the pleasant

    wind of morn
    The wood resounds with cry of hounds and

    blare of hunters horn

    In the garden of her father little Elsie sits

    and spins
    And singing with the early birds her daily

    task begins
    Gay tulijjs bloom and sweet mint curls

    around her gardenbower
    But she is sweeter than the mint and fairer

    than the flower

    About her form her kirtle blue clings lov
    ingly and white

    As snow her loose sleeves only leave her
    small round wrists in sight

    Below the modest petticoat can only half
    conceal

    The motion of the lightest foot that ever
    turned a wheel

    The cat sits purring at her side bees hum

    in sunshine warm
    But look  she starts she lifts her face

    she shades it with her arm



    KING VOLMER AND ELSIE



    3



    Aud hark  a train of horsemen with sound
    of dog and horn

    Come leaping oer the ditches come tramp
    ling down the corn

    Merrily rang the bridlereins and scarf and

    plume streamed gay
    As fast beside her fathers gate the riders

    held their way
    And one was brave in scarlet cloak with

    golden spur on heel
    Aud as he checked his foaming steed the

    maiden checked her wheel

    All hail among thy roses the faiiest rose

    to me
    For weary months in secret my heart has

    longed for thee
    What noble knight was this  What words

    for modest maidens ear
    She dropped a lowly coiutesy of bashful

    uess and fear

    She lifted up her spinningwheel  she fain

    would seek the door
    Trembling in every limb her cheek with

    blushes crimsoned oer
    Nay fear me not the rider said  I

    offer heart and hand
    Bear witness these good Danish knights

    who round about me stand

    I grant jon time to think of this to an
    swer as you may

    For tomorrow little Elsie shall bring
    another day

    He spake the old phrase slyly as glancing
    round his train

    He saw his merry followers seek to hide
    their smiles in vain

    The snow of pearls I 11 scatter in your

    curls of golden hair
    I 11 line with furs the velvet of the kirtle

    that you wear
    All precious gems shall twine your neck

    and in a chariot gay
    You shall ride my little Elsie behind four

    steeds of gray

    And harps shall sound and flutes shall
    play and brazen lamps shall glow

    On marble floors your feet shall weave the
    dances to and fro



    At frosty eventide for us the blazing hearth

    shall shine
    While at our ease we play at draughts and

    drink the bloodred wine

    Then Elsie raised her head and met her

    wooer face to face
    A roguish smile shone in her eye and on

    her lip found place
    Back from her low white forehead the

    curls of gold she threw
    And lifted up her eyes to his steady and

    clear and blue

    I am a lowly peasant and you a gallant

    knight
    I will not trust a love that soon may cool

    and turn to slight
    If you would wed me henceforth be a

    peasant not a lord
    I bid you hang upon the wall your tried

    and trusty sword

    To please you Elsie I will lay keen Dy

    nadel away
    And in its place will swing the scythe and

    mow your fathers hay
    Nay but your gallant scarlet cloak my

    eyes can never bear
    A Vadmal coat so plain and gray is all

    that you must wear

    Well Vadmal will I wear for you the

    rider gayly spoke
    And on the Lords high altar I 11 lay my

    scarlet cloak
    But mark she said  no stately horse

    my peasant love must ride
    A yoke of steers before the plough is all

    that he must guide

    The knight looked down upon his steed

    Well let him wander free
    No other man must ride the horse that has

    been backed by me
    Henceforth I 11 tread the furrow and to

    my oxen talk
    If only little Elsie beside my plough will

    walk

    You must take from out your cellar cask
    of wine and flask and can

    The homely mead I brew you may serve a
    peasantman



    114



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Most willingly fair Elsie I 11 drink that

    mead of thine
    And leave my minstrels thirsty throat to

    drain my generous wine

    Now break your shield asunder and

    shatter sign and boss
    Unmeet for peasant  wedded arms your

    knightly knee across
    And pull me down your castle from top to

    basement wall
    And let your plough trace furrows in the

    ruins of your hall

    Then smiled he with a lofty pride  right

    well at last he knew
    The maiden of the spinningwheel was to

    her trothplight true
    Ah roguish little Elsie  you act your part

    full well
    You know that I must bear my shield and

    in my castle dwell

    The lions ramping on that shield between

    the hearts aflame
    Keep watch oer Denmarks honor and

    guard her ancient name
    For know that I am Volmer  I dwell in

    yonder towers
    Who ploughs them ploughs up Denmark

    this goodly home of ours

    I tempt no more fair Elsie  your heart

    I know is true
    Would God that all our maidens were good

    and pure as you
    Well have you pleased your monarch and

    he shall well repay
    Gods peace  Farewell  Tomorrow will

    bring another day

    He lifted up his bridle hand he spurred his

    good steed then
    And like a whirlblast swept away with all

    his gallant men
    The steel hoofs beat the rocky path  again

    on winds of morn
    The wood resounds with cry of hounds and

    blare of hunters horn

    Thou true and ever faithful   the listen
    ing Henrik cried

    And leaping oer the green hedge he stood
    by Elsies side



    None saw the fond embracing save shin
    ing from afar

    The Golden Goose that watched them from
    the tower of Valdemar

    O darling girls of Denmark  of all the

    floweis that throng
    Her vales of spring the fairest I sing for

    you my song
    No praise as yours so bravely rewards the

    singers skill
    Thank God  of maids like Elsie the land

    has plenty still



    THE THREE BELLS

    Beneath the lowhung night cloud
    That raked her splintering mast

    The good ship settled slowly
    The cruel leak gained fast

    Over the awful ocean

    Her signal guns pealed out

    Dear God  was that Thy answer
    From the horror round about

    A voice came down the wild wind
    Ho  ship ahoy   its cry
    Our stout Three Bells of Glasgow
    Shall lay till daylight by

    Hour after hour crept slowly
    Yet on the heaving swells

    Tossed up and down the shiplights
    The lights of the Three Bells

    And ship to ship made signals
    Man answered back to man

    While oft to cheer and hearten
    The Three Bells nearer ran

    And the captain from her taffrail
    Sent down his hopeful cry
    Take heart  Hold on   he shouted
    The Three Bells shall lay by

    All night across the waters

    The tossing lights shone clear

    All night from reeling taffrail
    The Three Bells sent her cheer

    And when the dreary watches
    Of storm and darkness passed



    JOHN UNDERHILL



    Just as the wreck lurched under
    All souls were saved at last

    Sail on Three Bells forever
    In grateful memory sail

    Ring on Three Bells of rescue
    Above the wave and gale

    Type of the Love eternal
    Repeat the Masters cry

    As tossing tlirough our darkness
    The lights of God draw nigh



    JOHN UNDERHILL

    A SCORE of years had come and gone
    Since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth

    stone
    When Captain Underhill bearing scars
    From Indian ambush and Flemish wars
    Left three hilled Boston and wandered

    down
    East by north to Cocheco town

    With Vane the younger in council sweet
    He had sat at Anna Hutchinsons feet
    And when the bolt of banishment fell
    On the head of his saintly oracle
    He had shared her ill as her good report
    And braved the wrath of the General
    Court

    He shook from his feet as he rode away

    The dust of the Massachusetts Bay

    The world might bless and the world might

    ban
    What did it matter the perfect man
    To whom the freedom of earth was given
    Proof against sin and sure of heaven

    He cheered his heart as he rode along
    With screed of Scripture and holy song
    Or thought how he rode with his lances

    free
    By the Lower Rhine and the ZuyderZee
    Till his wood path grew to a trodden

    road
    And Hilton Point in the distance showed

    He saw the church with the blockhouse

    nigh
    The two fair rivers the flakes thereby
    And tacking to windward low and crank
    The little shallop from Strawberry Bank



    And he rose in his stirrups and looked

    abroad
    Over land and water and praised the Lord

    Goodly and stately and grave to see

    Into the clearings space rode he

    With the sun on the hilt of his sword in

    sheath
    And his silver buckles and spurs beneath
    And the settlers welcomed him one and all
    From swift Quampeagan to Gonie Fall

    And he said to the elders   Lo I come
    As the way seemed open to seek a home
    Somewhat the Lord hath wrought by my

    hands
    In the Narragansett and Netherlands
    And if here ye have work for a Christian

    man
    I will tarry and serve ye as best I can

    I boast not of gifts but fain would own
    The wonderful favor God hath shown
    The special naercy vouchsafed one day
    On the shore of Narragansett Bay
    As I sat with my pipe from the cam aside
    And mused like Isaac at eventide

    A sudden sweetness of peace I found
    A garment of gladness wrapped me round
    I felt from the law of works released
    The strife of the flesh and spirit ceased
    My faith to a full assurance grew
    And all I had hoped for myself I knew

    Now as God appointeth I keep my

    way
    I shall not stumble I shall not stray
    He hath taken away my figleaf dress
    I wear the robe of His righteousness
    And the shafts of Satan no more avail
    Than Pequot arrows on Christian mail

    Tarry with ns the settlers cried
    Thou man of God as our ruler and guide
    Aiid Captain Underhill bowed his head
    The will of the Lord be done   he said
    And the morrow beheld him sitting down
    In the rulers seat in Cocheco town

    And he judged therein as a just man should
    His words were wise and his rule was good
    He coveted not his neighbors land
    From the holding of bribes he shook his
    hand

    And through the camps of the heathen

    ran
    A wholesome fear of the valiant man

    But the heart is deceitful the good Book

    saith
    And life hath ever a savor of death
    Through hymns of triumph the tempter

    calls
    And whoso thinketh he standeth falls
    Alas  ere their round the seasons ran
    There was grief in the soul of the saintly

    man

    The tempters arrows that rarely fail
    Had found the joints of his spiritual mail
    And men took note of his gloomy air
    The shame in his eye the halt in his prayer
    The signs of a battle lost withiu
    The pain of a soul in the coils of sin

    Then a whisper of scandal linked his name
    With broken vows and a life of blame
    And the people looked askance on him
    As he walked among them sullen and grim
    111 at ease and bitter of word
    And prompt of quarrel witli hand or sword

    None knew how with prayer and fasting

    still
    He strove in the bonds of his evil will
    Bit he shook himself like Samson at length
    And girded anew his loins of strength
    And bade the crier go up and down
    And call together the wondering town

    Jeer and murmur and shaking of head
    Ceased as he rose in his place and said
    Men brethren and fathers well ye know
    How I came among you a year ago
    Strong in the faith that my soul was freed
    From siu of feeling or thought or deed

    I have sinned I own it with grief and

    shame
    But not with a lie on my lips I came
    In my blindness I verily thought my heart
    Swept and garnished in every part
    He chargeth His angels with folly  He

    sees
    The heavens unclean Was I more than

    these

    I urge no plea At your feet I lay
    The trust you gave me and go my way



    Hate me or pity me as you will
    The Lord will have mercy on sinners still
    And I who am ehiefest say to all
    Watch and pray lest ye also fall

    No voice made answer  a sob so low

    That only his quickened ear could know

    Smote his heart with a bitter pain

    As into the forest he rode again

    And the veil of its oaken leaves shut

    down
    On his latest glimpse of Cocheco town

    Crystalclear on the man of sin

    The streams Hashed uj and the sky shone

    in
    On his cheek of fever the cool wind blew
    The leaves dropped on him their tears of

    dew
    And angels of God in the pure sweet

    guise
    Of flowers looked on him with sad surprise

    Was his ear at fault that brook and breeze
    Sang in their saddest of minor keys
    What was it the mournful woodthrush

    said
    What whispered the pinetrees overhead
    Did he hear the Voice on his lonely way
    That Adam heard in the cool of day

    Into the desert alone rode he

    Alone with the Infinite Purity

    And bowing his soul to its tender rebuke

    As Peter did to the Masters look

    He measured his path with prayers of

    pain
    For peace with God and nature again

    And in after years to Cocheco came
    The bruit of a once familiar name
    How among the Dutch of New Nether
    lands
    From wild Danskamer to Haailem sands
    A enitent soldier preached the Word
    And smote the heathen with Gideons
    sword

    And the heart of Boston was glad to hear
    How he harried the foe on the long fron
    tier
    And heaped on the land against him barred
    The coals of his generous watch and ward
    Frailest and bravest  the Bay State still
    Counts with her worthies John Underbill

    Smitten to death a crushed and mangled

    Sank with the brake he grasped just where

    he stood
    To do the utmost that a brave man could
    And die if needful as a true man should

    Men stooped above him  women dropped

    their tears

    THE WITCH OF WENHAM

    The house is still standing in Danvers Mass
    where it is said a suspected witch was con
    fined overnight in the attic which was bolted
    fast In the morning when the constable came
    to take her to ISaleni for trial she was missing
    althoiigh the door was still bolted Her escape
    was doubtless aided by her friends but at the
    time it was attributed to Satanic interference



    Along Crane Rivers sunny slopes
    Blew warm the winds of May

    And over Naumkeags ancient oaks
    The green outgrew the gray

    The grass was green on Rialside

    The early birds at will
    Waked up the violet in its dell

    The windflower on its hill

    Where go you in your Sunday coat
    Son Andrew tell me pray

    For striped perch in Wenham Lake
    I go to fish today

    Unharmed of thee in Wenham Lake

    The mottled perch shall be

    A blueeyed witch sits on the bank

    And weaves her net for thee

    She weaves her golden hair  she sings
    Her spellsong low and faint
    The wickedest witch in Salem jail
    Is to that girl a saint

    Nay mother hold thy cruel tongue

    God knows the young man cried
    He never made a whiter soul

    Than hers by Wenham side

    She tends her mother sick and blind
    And every want supplies
    To her above the blessed Book
    She lends her soft blue eyes

    Her voice is glad with holy songs
    Her lips are sweet with prayer

    He went his way  the old wives shook


    By Wenham water words


    With fear as he drew nigh


    That made the buttercups take wings


    The children in the dooryards held

    THE WITCH OF WENHAM



    119



    Sat shaping for her bridal dress

    Her mothers wedding gown
    When lo  the marshal writ in hand

    From Alford hill rode down

    His face was hard with cruel fear
    He grasped the maidens hands

    Come with me unto Salem town
    For so the law commands

    Oh let me to my mother say

    Farewell before I go
    He closer tied her little hands

    Unto his saddle bow

    Unhand me cried she piteonsly
    For thy sweet daughters sake

    I 11 keep my daughter safe he said
    From the witch of Wenham Lake

    Oh leave me for my mothers sake

    She needs my eyes to see
    Those eyes young witch the crows shall
    peck

    From off the gallowstree

    He bore her to a farmhouse old

    And up its stairway long
    And closed on her the garretdoor

    With iron bolted strong

    The day died out the night came down

    Her evening prayer she said
    While through the dark strange faces
    seemed

    To mock her as she prayed

    The present horror deepened all
    The fears her childhood knew

    The awe wherewith the air was filled
    With every breath she drew

    And could it be she trembling asked

    Some secret thought or sin
    Had shut good angels from her heart

    And let the bad ones in

    Had she in some forgotten dream

    Let go her hold on Heaven
    And sold herself unwittingly

    To spirits unforgiven

    Oh weird and still the dark hours
    passed
    No human sound she heard



    But up and down the chimney stack
    The swallows moaned and stirred

    And oer her with a dread surmise

    Of evil sight and sound
    The blind bats on their leathern wings

    Went wheeling round and round

    Low hanging in the midnight sky
    Looked in a halffaced moon

    Was it a dieam or did she hear
    Her lovers whistled tune

    She forced the oaken scuttle back

    A whisper reached her ear
    Slide down the roof to me it said

    So softly none may hear

    She slid along the sloping roof
    Till from its eaves she hung

    And felt the loosened shingles yield
    To which her fingers chmg

    Below her lover stretched his hands
    And touched her feet so small

    Drop down to me dear heart he said
    My arms shall break the fall

    He set her on his pillion soft
    Her arms about him twined

    And noiseless as if velvetshod
    They left the house behind

    But when they reached the open way

    Full free the rein he cast
    Oh never through the mirk midnight

    Rode man and maid more fast

    Along the wild woodpaths they sped
    The bridgeless streams they swam

    At set of moon they passed the Bass
    At sunrise Agawam

    At high noon on the Merrimac

    The ancient ferryman
    Forgot at times his idle oars

    So fair a freight to scan

    And when from off his grounded boat
    He saw them momit and ride

    God keep her from the evil eye
    And harm of witch   he cried

    The maiden laughed as youth will laugh
    At all its fears gone by

    He does not know she whispered
    low
    A little witch am I

    All day he urged his weary horse

    And in the red sundown
    Drew rein before a friendly door

    In distant Berwick town

    A fellowfeeling for the wronged

    The Quaker people felt
    And safe beside their kindly hearths

    The hunted maiden dwelt

    Until from off its breast the land

    The haunting horror threw
    And hatred born of ghastly dreams

    To shame and pity grew

    Sad were the years spring morns and
    sad

    Its golden summer day
    But blithe and glad its withered fields

    And skies of ashen gray

    For spell and charm had power no more
    The spectres ceased to roam

    And scattered households knelt again
    Around the hearths of home

    And when once more by Beaver Dam

    The meadowlark outsang
    And once again on all the hills

    The early violets sprang

    And all the windy pasture slopes

    Lay green within the arms
    Of creeks that bore the salted sea

    To pleasant inland farms

    The smith filed oP the chains he forged
    The jailbolts backward fell

    KING SOLOMON AND THE ANTS

    Out from Jerusalem

    The king rode with liis great
    War chiefs and lords of state

    And Shebas queen with them

    Comely but black withal
    To whom perchance belongs



    That wondrous Song of songs
    Sensuous and mystical

    Whereto devout souls turn

    In fond ecstatic dream

    And through its earthborn theme
    The Love of loves discern

    Proud in the Syrian sun
    In gold and purple sheen
    The dusky Ethiop queen

    Smiled on King Solomon

    Wisest of men he knew
    The languages of all
    The creatures great or small

    That trod the earth or flew

    Across an anthill led

    The kings path and he heard
    Its small folk and their word

    He thus interpreted

    Here comes the king men greet
    As wise and good and just
    To crush us in the dust
    Under his heedless feet

    The great king bowed his head
    And saw the wide surprise
    Of the Queen of Shebas eyes

    As he told her what they said

    O king   she whispered sweet
    Too happy fate have they
    Who perish in thy way
    Beneath thy gracious feet

    Thou of the Godlent crown

    Shall these vile creatures dare
    Murmur against thee where
    The knees of kings kneel down

    Nay Solomon replied

    The wise and strong should seek
    The welfare of the weak
    And turned bis horse aside

    His train with quick alarm

    Curved with their leader round
    Tlie anthills peopled mound

    And left it free from harm

    The jewelled head bent low

    O king 1  she said  henceforth



    IN THE OLD SOUTH



    The secret of thy worth

    IN THE OLD SOUTH

    On the 8th of July 1677 Margaret Brew
    ster with four other Friends went into the South
    Church in time of meeting  in sackcloth with
    ashes upon her head barefoot and her face
    blackened and delivered  a warimig from
    the great God of Heaven and Earth to the
    Rulers aud Magistrates of Boston For the
    offence she was sentenced to be  whipped at
    a carts tail up and down the Town with
    twenty lashes

    She came and stood in the Old South
    Church

    A wonder and a sign
    With a look the oldtime sibyls wore

    Halfcrazed and halfdivine

    Save the mournful sackcloth about her
    wound
    Unclothed as the primal mother
    With limbs that trembled and eyes that
    blazed
    With a fire she dare not smother

    Loose on her shoulders fell her hair

    With sprinkled ashes gray
    She stood in the broad aisle strange and
    weird

    As a soul at the judgment day

    And the minister paused in his sermons
    midst
    And the people held their breath
    For these were the words the maiden
    spoke
    Through lips as the lips of death

    Thus saith the Lord with equal feet
    All men my courts shall tread

    And priest and ruler no more shall eat
    My people up like bread

    Repent  repent  ere the Lord shall
    speak
    In thunder and breaking seals



    Let all souls worship Him in the way
    His light within reveals

    She shook the dust from her naked feet
    And her sackcloth closer drew

    And into the porch of the awe hushed
    church
    She passed like a ghost from view

    They whipped her away at the tail o the
    cart
    Through half the streets of the town
    But the words she uttered that day nor
    fire
    Could burn nor water drown

    And now the aisles of the ancient church

    By equal feet are trod
    And the bell that swings in its belfry rings

    Freedom to worship God

    And now whenever a wrong is done

    It thrills the conscious walls
    The stone from the basement cries aloud

    And the beam from the timber calls

    There are steeplehouses on every hand
    And pulpits that bless and ban

    And the Lord will not grudge the single
    church
    That is set apart for man

    For in two commandments are all the law
    And the prophets under the sun

    And the first is last and the last is first
    And the twain are verily one

    So long as Boston shall Boston be
    And her baytides rise and fall

    Shall freedom stand in the Old South
    Church
    And plead for the rights of all

    THE HENCHMAN

    Written at the request of a young lady
    who said to the poet   Mr Whittier you
    never wrote a love song I do not believe you
    can write one I wish you would try to write
    one for me to sing In sending the poem
    afterward to the editor of The Independent
    Whittier wrote   I send in compliance with
    the wish of Mr Bowen and thyself a ballad
    upon which though not long I have bestowed
    a good deal of labor It is not exactly a



    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    Quakerly piece nor is it didactic and it has
    no moral that I know of But it is I think
    natural simple and not uupoetical

    My lady walks her morning round
    My ladys page her fleet greyhound
    My ladys hair the fond winds stir
    And all the birds make songs for her

    Her thrushes sing in Rathburn bowers
    And Rathburn side is gay with flowers
    But neer like hers in flower or bird
    Was beauty seen or niusic heard

    The distance of the stars is hers
    The least of all her worsliippers
    The dust beneath her dainty heel
    She knows not that I see or feel

    Oh proud and calm   she cannot know
    Whereer she goes with her I go
    Oh cold and fair   she cannot guess
    I kneel to share her hounds caress

    Gay knights beside her hunt and hawk
    I rob their ears of her sweet talk
    Her suitors come from east and west
    I steal her smiles from every guest

    Unheard of her in loving words
    I greet her with the song of birds
    I reach her with her green  armed bow
    ers
    I kiss her with the lips of flowers

    The hound and I are on her trail
    The wind and I uplift her veil
    As if the calm cold moon she were
    And I the tide I follow her

    As unrebuked as they I share
    The license of the sun and air
    And in a common homage hide
    My worship from her scorn and pride

    Worldwide ajjart and yet so near
    I breathe her charmed atmosphere
    Wherein to her my service brings
    The reverence due to holy things

    Her maiden pride her haughty name
    My dumb devotion shall not shame
    The love that no return dotli crave
    To knightly levels lifts the slave



    No lance have I in joust or fight
    To splinter in my ladys sight
    But at her feet how blest were I
    For any need of hers to die



    THE



    DEAD FEAST OF THE
    KOLFOLK



    E B Tylor in his Primitive Culture chapter
    xii gives an account of the reverence paid the
    dead by the Kol tribes of Chota Nagpur Assam
    When a Ho or Mimda he says has been
    burned on the funeral pile coUected morsels
    of his bones are carried in procession with a
    solenui ghostly sliding step keeping time to
    the deepsounding drum and ftlien the old
    woman who carries the bones on her bamboo
    tray lowers it from time to time then girls
    who carry pitchers and brass vessels mournf idly
    reverse them to show that they are empty  thus
    the remains are taken to visit every house in the
    village and every dwelling of a friend or rela
    tive for miles and the inmates come out to
    mourn and praise the goodness of the departed
    the bones are carried to all the dead mans
    favorite haunts to the fields he cultivated to
    the grove he jjlanted to the threshingfloor
    where he worked to the village danceroom
    where he made merry At last they are taken
    to the grave and buried in an earthen vase
    upon a store of food covered with one of those
    huge stone slabs which European visitors won
    der at in the districts of the aborigines of
    India In the Journal of the Asiatic Society

    They waste us and smite us

    Our days are but few
    In strange lands far yonder

    We wait without fearing
    To feel you draw near

    THE KHANS DEVIL

    The Khan came from Bokhara town
    To Hamza santon of renown

    My head is sick my hands are weak
    Thy help O holy man I seek

    In silence marking for a space

    The Khans red eyes and purple face

    Thick voice and loose uncertain tread
    Thou hast a devil   Hamza said

    Allah forbid   exclaimed the Khan
    Rid me of him at once O man

    Nay Hamza said  no spell of mine
    Can slay that cursed thing of thine

    Leave feast and wine go forth and drink
    Water of healing on tbe brink

    Where clear and cold from mountain

    snows
    The Nabr el Zeben downward flows

    Six moons remain then come to me
    May Allahs pity go with thee

    Awestruck from feast and wine the Khan
    Went forth where Nahr el Zeben ran

    Roots were his food the desert dust
    His bed the water quenched his thirst

    And when the sixth moons scimitar
    Curved sharp above the evening star

    He sought again the santons door
    Not weak and trembling as before

    But strong of limb and clear of brain
    Behold he said  the fiend is slain

    Nay Hamza answered  starved and

    drowned
    The curst one lies in deathlike swound

    With water quench the fiie within
    And drown each day thy devilkin

    Thenceforth the great Khan shunned the cup
    As Shitans own though offered up

    A devil Khan el Hamed saith

    Wisely our Prophet cursed the vine
    The fiend that loves the breath of wine

    No prayer can slay no marabout
    Nor Meccan dervis can drive out

    I Khan el Hamed know the charm
    That robs him of his power to harm

    Diown him O Islams child  the spell
    To save thee lies in tank and well

    THE KINGS MISSIVE
    1661

    This ballad originally written for The Memo
    rial Histori of Boston describes with pardon
    able poetic license a memorable incident in
    the annals of the city The interview between
    Shattuck and the Governor took place I have
    since learned in the residence of the latter and
    not in the Council Chamber The publication
    of the ballad led to some discussion as to the
    historical truthfulness of the picture but I have
    seen no reason to rub out any of the figures or
    alter the lines and colors



    Under the great hill sloping bare

    To cove and meadow and Common lot
    In his council chamber and oaken chair
    Sat the worshipful Governor Endicott
    A grave strong man who knew no peer
    In the pilgrim laud where he ruled in fear
    Of God not man and for good or ill
    Held his trust with an iron will

    He had shorn with his sword the cross from
    out

    The Hag and cloven the Maypole down
    Harried the heathen round about

    And whipped the Quakers from town to
    town
    Earnest and honest a man at need
    To burn like a torch for his own harsh creed
    He kept with the flaming brand of his zeal
    The gate of the holy common weal

    His brow was clouded his eye was stern
    With a look of mingled sorrow and

    wrath
    Woe s me   he muinmired   at every

    turn
    The pestilent Quakers are in my path
    Some we have scourged and banished some
    Some hanged more doomed and still they

    come
    Fast as the tide of yon bay sets in
    Sowing their heresys seed of sin

    Did we count on this  Did we leave be
    hind
    The graves of our kin the comfort and
    ease
    Of our English hearths and homes to find

    Troublers of Israel such as tliese
    Shall I spare  Shall I pity them  God

    forbid
    I will do as the prophet to Agag did
    They come to poison the wells of the Word
    I will hew them in jjieces before the Lord

    The door swung open and Rawson the clerk

    Entered and whispered under breath
    There waits below for the hangmans work

    A fellow banished on pain of death
    Shattuck of Salem unhealed of the whip
    Brought over in Master Goldsmiths ship
    At anchor here in a Christian port
    With freight of the devil and all his sort

    Twice and thrice on the chamber floor
    Striding fiercely from wall to wall



    THE KINGS MISSIVE



    125



    The Lord do so to me and more

    The Governor cried  if I hang not all
    Bring hither the Quaker Calm sedate
    With the look of a man at ease with fate
    Into that presence grim and dread
    Came Samuel Shattuck with hat on head

    Off with the knaves hat   An angry
    hand
    Smote down the offence  but the wearer
    said
    With a quiet smile  By the kings com
    mand
    I bear his message and stand in his stead
    In the Governors hand a missive he laid
    With the royal arms on its seal displayed
    And the proud man spake as he gazed

    thereat
    Uncovering  Give Mr Shattuck his hat

    He turned to the Quaker bowing low
    The king commaudeth your friends
    release

    Doubt not he shall be obeyed although
    To his subjects sorrow and sins increase

    What he here enjoineth John Endicott

    His loyal servant questioneth not

    You are free  God grant the spirit you
    own

    May take you from us to parts unknown

    So the door of the jail was open cast

    And like Daniel out of the lions den
    Tender youth and girlhood passed

    With agebowed women and graylocked
    men
    And the voice of one appointed to die
    Was lifted in praise and thanks on high
    And the little maid from New Netherlands
    Kissed in her joy the doomed mans hands

    And one whose call was to minister

    To the souls in prison beside him went
    An ancient woman bearing with her

    The linen shroud for his burial meant
    For she not counting her own life dear
    In the strength of a love that cast out fear
    Had watched and served where her brethren

    died
    Like those who waited the cross beside

    One moment they paused on their way to
    look
    On the martyr graves by the Common
    side



    And much scourged Wharton of Salem took

    His burden of prophecy up and cried
    Rest souls of the valiant  Not in vain
    Have ye borne the Masters cross of pain
    Ye bave fought the fight ye are victors

    crowned
    With a fourfold chain ye have Satan

    bound

    The autumn haze lay soft and still

    On wood and meadow and upland farms
    On the brow of Snow Hill the great wind
    mill
    Slowly and lazily swung its arms
    Broad in the sunshine stretched away
    With its capes and islands the turquoise

    bay
    And over water and dusk of pines
    Blue hills lifted their faint outlines

    The topaz leaves of the walnut glowed
    The sumach added its crimson fleck
    And double in air and water showed

    The tinted maples along the Neck
    Through frost flower clusters of pale star
    mist
    And gentian fringes of amethyst
    And royal plumes of goldenrod
    The grazing cattle on Gentry trod

    But as they who see not the Quakers saw

    The world about them  they only thought
    With deep thanksgiving and pious awe
    On the great deliverance God had
    wrought
    Through lane and alley the gazing town
    Noisily followed them up and down
    Some with scoffing and brutal jeer
    Some with pity and words of cheer

    One brave voice rose above the din

    Upsall gray with his length of days
    Cried from the door of his lied Lion Inn

    Men of Boston give God the praise
    No more shall innocent blood call down
    The bolts of wrath on your guilty town
    The freedom of worship dear to you
    Is dear to all and to all is due

    I see the vision of days to come
    When your beautiful City of the Bay

    Shall be Christian libertys chosen home
    And none shall his neighbors rights
    gainsay

    The varying notes of worship shall blend

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    And as one great prayer to God ascend
    And hands of mutual charity raise
    Walls of salvation and gates of praise

    So passed the Quakers through Boston
    town

    Whose painful ministers sighed to see
    The walls of their sheepfold falling down

    And wolves of heresy prowling free
    But the years went on and brought no

    wrong
    With milder counsels the State grew strong
    As outward Letter and inward Light
    Kept the balance of truth aright

    The Puritan spirit perishing not

    To Concords yeomen the signal sent
    And spake in the voice of the cannonshot
    That severed the chains of a continent
    With its gentler mission of peace and good
    will
    The thought of the Quaker is living still
    And the freedom of soul he prophesied
    Is gospel and law where the martyrs died



    VALUATION

    The old Squire said as he stood by his
    gate

    And his neighbor the Deacon went by
    In spite of my bank stock and real estate

    You are better off Deacon than I

    We re both growing old and the end s
    drawing near
    You have less of this world to resign
    But in Heavens appraisal your assets I
    fear
    Will reckon up greater than mine

    They say I am rich but Im feeling so
    poor
    I wish I could swap with you even
    The pounds I have lived for and laid up in
    store
    For the shillings and pence you have
    given

    Well Squire said the Deacon with
    shrewd common sense
    While his eye had a twinkle of fun
    Let your pounds take the way of my shil
    lings and pence
    And the thing can be easily done



    RABBI ISHMAEL

    Rabbi Ishmael Ben Elisha said Once I
    entered into the Holy of Holies as High Priest
    to burn incense when I saw Aktriel the Di
    vine Crown Jah Lord of Hosts sitting upon
    a throne high and lifted up who said unto
    me  Ishmael my son bless me I answered
    May it please Thee to make Thy conqxission pre
    vail over Thine anger  may it be revealed above
    Thy other attributes mayest Thou deal with
    Thy children according to it and not according
    to the strict measure of judgment It seemed to
    me that He bowed His head as though to an
    swer Amen to my blessing  Talmud Bera
    choth i f 6 b

    The Rabbi Ishmael with the woe and sin
    Of the world heavy upon him entering in
    The Holy of Holies saw an awful Face
    With terrible splendor filling all the place
    O Ishmael Ben Elisha   said a voice
    What seekest thou  What blessing is

    thy choice
    And knowing that he stood before the Lord
    Within the shadow of the cherubim
    Widewinged between the blinding light

    and him
    He bowed himself and uttered not a word
    But in the silence of his soul was prayer
    O Tliou Eternal  I am one of all
    And nothing ask that others may not share
    Thou art almighty  we are weak and

    small
    And yet Thy children  let Thy mercy

    spare
    Trembling he raised his eyes and in the

    place
    Of the insufferable glory lo  a face
    Of more than mortal tenderness that bent
    Graciously down in token of assent
    And smiling vanished  With strange joy

    elate
    The wondering Rabbi sought the temples

    gate
    Radiant as Moses from the Mount he

    stood
    And cried aloud unto the multitude
    O Israel hear  The Lord our God is

    good
    Mine eyes have seen His glory and His

    grace
    Beyond His judgments shall His love en
    dure
    The mercy of the All Merciful is sure

    THE ROCKTOMB OF BRADORE

    H Y Hind in Explorations in the Interior of
    the Labrador Peninsula ii 166 mentions the
    finding of a rock tonib near the little fishing
    port of Bradore with the inscription upon it
    which is given in the poem

    A DREAR and desolate shore
    Where no tree unfolds its leaves
    Aud never the spring wind weaves
    Green grass for the hunters tread
    A land forsaken and dead
    Where the ghostly icebergs go
    And come with the ebb and flow

    Of the waters of Bradore

    A wanderer from a land

    By summer breezes fanned

    Looked round him awed subdued

    By the dreadful solitude

    Hearing alone the cry

    Of seabirds clanging by

    The crash aud grind of the floe

    Wail of wind and wash of tide

    O wretched land   he cried

    Land of all lands the worst

    God forsaken and curst

    Thy gates of rock should show

    The words the Tuscan seer
    Read in the Realm of Woe

    Hope entereth not here

    Lo  at his feet there stood
    A block of smooth larch viood
    Waif of some wandering wave
    Beside a rockclosed cave
    By Nature fashioned for a grave
    Safe from the ravening bear
    And fierce fowl of the air
    Wherein to rest was laid
    A twenty summers maid
    Whose blood had equal share
    Of the lands of vine and snow
    Half French half Eskimo
    In letters unefFaced
    Upon the block were traced
    The grief and hope of man
    And thus the legend ran

    We loved her
    Words cannot tell how well

    We loved her

    God loved her
    And called her home to peace and rest

    We love her



    The stranger paused and read

    O winter land   he said

    Thy right to be I own

    God leaves thee not alone

    And if thy fierce winds blow

    Over drear wastes of rock and snow

    And at thy iron gates

    The ghostly iceberg waits

    Thy homes and hearts are dear
    Thy sorrow oer thy sacred dust
    Is sanctified by hope and trust

    Gods love and mans are here
    And love whereer it goes
    Makes its own atmosphere
    Its flowers of Paradise
    Take root in the eternal ice

    And bloom through Polar snows



    THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS

    The volume in which The Bay of Seven Is
    lands was published was dedicated to the late
    Edwin Percy Whipple to whom more than to
    any other person I was indebted for public re
    cognition as one worthy of a place in American
    literature at a tune when it required a great
    degree of courage to urge such a claim for
    a proscribed abolitionist Although younger
    than I he had gained the reputation of a bril
    liant essayist and was regarded as the highest
    American authority in criticism His wit and
    wisdom enlivened a small literary circle of
    young men including Thomas Starr King the
    eloquent preacher and Daniel N Haskell of
    the Daily Transcript who gathered about our
    common friend James T Fields at the Old
    Corner Bookstore The poem which gave title
    to the volume I inscribed to my friend and
    neighbor Harriet Prescott Spofford whose
    poems have lent a new interest to our beauti
    ful rivervalley

    From the green Amesbury hill which bears

    the name
    Of that half mythic ancestor of mine
    Who trod its slopes two hundred years ago
    Down the long valley of the Merrimac
    Midway between me and the rivers mouth
    I see thy home set like an eagles nest
    Among Deer Islands immemorial pines
    Crowning the crag on which the sunset

    breaks
    Its last red arrow Many a tale and song
    Which thou hast told or sung I call to

    mind
    Softening with silvery mist the woods and

    hills

    The outtlirnst headlands and inreaching
    bays

    Of our northeastern coastlme trending
    where

    The Gulf midsummer feels the chill block
    ade

    Of icebergs stranded at its northern gate

    To thee the echoes of the Island Sound
    Answer not vainly nor in vain the moan
    Of the South Breaker prophesying storm
    And thou hast listened like myself to men
    Seaperiled oft where Anticosti lies
    Like a fell spider in its web of fog
    Or where the Grand Bank shallows with

    the wrecks
    Of sunken fishers and to whom strange

    isles
    And frostrimmed bays and trading stations

    seem
    Familiar as Great Neck and Kettle Cove
    Nubble and Boon the common names of

    home
    So let me offer thee this lay of mine
    Simple and homely lacking much thy play
    Of color and of fancy If its theme
    And treatment seem to thee befitting youth
    Rather than age let this be my excuse
    It has beguiled some heavy hours and called
    Some pleasant memories up  and better

    still
    Occasion lent me for a kindly word
    To one who is my neighbor and my friend



    The skipper sailed out of the harbor mouth
    Leaving the applebloom of the South
    For the ice of the Eastern seas
    In his fishing schooner Breeze

    Handsome and brave and young was he
    And the maids of Newbury sighed to see

    His lessening white sail fall

    Under the seas blue wall

    Through the Northern Gulf and the misty

    screen
    Of the isles of Mingan and Madeleine

    St Pauls and Blanc Sablon

    The little Breeze sailed on

    Backward and forward along the shore
    Of lorn and desolate Labrador

    And found at last her way

    To the Seven Islands Bay



    The little hamlet nestling below
    Great hills white with lingering snow
    With its tinroofed chapel stood
    Half hid in the dwarf spruce wood

    Greenturfed flowersown the last outpost
    Of summer upon the dreary coast

    With its gardens small and spare

    Sad in the frosty air

    Hard by where the skippers schooner lay
    A fishermans cottage looked away

    Over isle and bay and behind

    On mountains diradefined

    And there twin sisters fair and young
    Laughed with their stranger guest and
    sung

    In their native tongue the lays

    Of the old Provencal days

    Alike were they save the faint outline
    Of a scar on Suzettes forehead fine
    And both it so befell
    Loved the heretic stranger well

    Both were pleasant to look upon

    But the heart of the skijiper clave to one

    Though less by his eje than heart

    He knew the twain apart

    Despite of alien race and creed

    Well did his wooing of Marguerite speed

    And the mothers wrath was vain

    As the sisters jealous pain

    The shrilltongued mistress her house for
    bade
    And solemn warning was sternly said

    By the blackrobed priest whose word

    As law the hamlet heard

    But half by voice and half by signs
    The skipper said  A warm sun shines

    On the greenbanked Merrimac

    Wait watch till I come back

    And when you see from my mast head
    The signal fly of a kerchief red

    My boat on the shore shall wait

    Come when the night is late

    Ah  weighed with childhoods haunts and

    friends
    And all that the home sky overbends



    THE BAY OF SEVEN ISLANDS



    129



    Did ever ycimg love fail
    To turn the trembling scale

    Under the night on the wet sea sands
    Slowly unclasjjed their plighted hands
    One to the cottage hearth
    And one to his sailors berth

    What was it the parting lovers heard

    Nor leaf nor ripple nor wing of bird
    But a listeners stealthy tread
    On the rockmoss crisp and dead

    He weighed his anchor and fished once
    more

    By the black coastline of Labrador

    And by love and the north wind driven
    Sailed back to the Islands Seven

    In the sunsets glow the sisters twain
    Saw the Breeze come sailing in again

    Said Suzette  Mother dear

    The heretics sail is here

    Go Marguerite to your room and hide

    Your door shall be bolted   the mother
    cried
    While Suzette ill at ease
    Watched the red sign of the Breeze

    At midnight down to the waiting skiff
    She stole in the shadow of the cliff
    And out of the Bays mouth ran
    The schooner with maid and man

    And all night long on a restless bed
    Her prayers to the Virgin Marguerite said

    And thought of her lovers pain

    Waiting for her in vain

    Did he pace the sands  Did he pause to
    hear

    The sound of her light step drawing near
    And as the slow hours passed
    Would he doubt her faith at last

    But when she saw through the misty pane
    The morning break on a sea of rain
    Could even her love avail
    To follow his vanished sail

    Meantime the Breeze with favoring wind
    Left the rugfjed Moisic hills behind

    And heard from an unseen shore

    The falls of Manitou roar



    On the morrows morn in the thick gray

    weather
    They sat on the reeling deck together

    Lover and counterfeit

    Of hapless Marguerite

    With a lovers hand from her forehead fair
    He smoothed away her jetblack hair

    What was it his fond eyes met

    The scar of the false Suzette

    Fiercely he shouted   Bear away
    East by north for the Seven Isles Bay
    The maiden wept and prajed
    But the ship her helm obeyed

    Once more the Bay of the Isles they found
    They heard the bell of the chapel sound
    And the chant of the dying sung
    In the harsh wild Indian tongue

    A feeling of mystery change and awe
    Was in all they heard and all they saw
    Spellbound the hamlet lay
    In the hush of its lonely bay

    And when they came to the cottage door
    The mother rose up from her weeping sore

    And with angry gestures met

    The scared look of Suzette

    Here is your daughter  the skipper said
    Give me the one I love instead

    But the woman sternly spake

    Go see if the dead will wake

    He looked Her sweet face still and white
    And strange in the noonday taper light

    She lay on her little bed

    With the cross at her feet and head

    In a passion of grief the strong man bent
    Down to her face and kissing it went

    Back to the waiting Breeze

    Back to the mournful seas

    Never again to the Merrimac

    And Newburys homes that bark came back
    Whether her fate slie met
    On the shores of Carraquette

    Miscou or Tracadie who can say
    But even yet at Seven Isles Bay

    Is told the ghostly tale

    Of a weird unspoken sail

    One in her wild despair

    THE WISHING BRIDGE

    Among the legends sung or said

    Along our rocky shore
    The Wishing Bridge of Marblehead

    May well be sung once more

    An hundred years ago so ran

    The oldtime story all
    Good wishes said above its span

    Would soon or late befall

    If pure and earnest never failed

    The prayers of man or maid
    For him who on the deep sea sailed

    For her at home who stayed

    Once thither came two girls from school

    And wished in childish glee
    And one would be a queen and rule

    And one the world would see

    Time passed  with change of hopes and
    fears

    And in the selfsame place
    Two women gray with middle years

    Stood wondering face to face

    With wakened memories as they met
    They queried what had been

    A poor mans wife am I and yet
    Said one  I am a queen

    My realm a little homestead is
    Where lacking crown and throne

    I rule by loving services
    And patient toil alone



    The other said   The great world lies

    Beyond me as it lay
    Oer loves and dutys boundaries

    My feet may never stray

    I see but common sights of home

    Its common sounds I hear
    My widowed mothers sickbed room

    Sufficeth for my sphere

    I read to her some pleasant page

    Of travel far and wide
    And in a dreamy pilgrimage

    We wander side by side

    And when at last she falls asleep

    My book becomes to me
    A magic glass  my watch I keep

    But all the world I see

    A farmwife queen your place you fill

    While fancys privilege
    Is mine to walk the earth at wiH

    Thanks to the Wishing Bridge

    Nay leave the legend for the truth

    The other cried  and say
    God gives the wishes of our youth

    But in His own best way

    HOW THE WOMEN WENT FROM DOVER



    131



    This warrant was executed only in Dover and
    Hampton At Salisbury the constable refused
    to obey it He was sustained by the towns
    people who were under the influence of Major
    Robert Pike the leading man in the lower val
    ley of the Merrimac who stood far in advance
    of his time as an advocate of religious freedom
    and an opponent of ecclesiastical authority
    He had the moral courage to address an able
    and manly letter to the court at Salem remon
    strating against the witchcraft trials

    The tossing spray of Cochecos fall

    Hardened to ice on its rocky wall

    As tbrongh Dover town in the chill gray

    dawn
    Three women passed at the cart  tail

    drawn

    Bared to the waist for the north winds grip
    And keener sting of the constables whip
    The blood that followed each hissing blow
    Froze as it sprinkled the winter snow

    Priest and ruler boy and maid
    Followed the dismal cavalcade
    And from door and window open thrown
    Looked and wondered gaffer and crone

    God is our witness the victims cried
    We suffer for Him who for all men died
    The wrong ye do has been done before
    We bear the stripes that the Master bore

    And thou O Richard Waldron for whom
    We hear the feet of a coming doom
    On thy cruel heart and thy hand of wrong
    Vengeance is sure though it tarry long

    In the light of the Lord a flame we see
    Climb and kindle a proud rooftree
    And beneath it an old man lying dead
    With stains of blood on his hoary head

    Smite Goodman Hate  Evil   harder
    still

    The magistrate cried  lay on with a will

    Drive out of their bodies the Father of
    Lies

    Who through them preaches and prophe
    sies

    So into the forest they held their way
    By winding river and frostrimmed bay
    Over windswept hills that felt the beat
    Of the winter sea at their icy feet



    The Indian hunter searching his traps
    Peered stealthily through the forest gaps
    And the outlying settler shook his head
    They re witches going to jail he said

    At last a meetinghouse came in view
    A blast on his horn the constable blew
    And the boys of Hampton cried up and down
    The Quakers have come   to the won
    dering town

    From barn and woodpile the goodman came
    The goodwife quitted her quilting frame
    With her child at her breast  and hobbling

    slow
    The grandam followed to see the show

    Once more the torturing whip was swung
    Once more keen lashes the bare flesh stung
    Oh spare  they are bleeding   a little

    maid cried
    And covered her face the sight to hide

    A murmur ran round the crowd   Good

    folks
    Quoth the constable busy counting the

    strokes
    No pity to wretches like these is due
    They have beaten the gospel black and

    blue

    Then a pallid woman in wildeyed fear
    With her wooden noggin of milk drew near
    Drink poor hearts   a rude hand smote
    Her draught away from a parching throat

    Take heed one whispered  they 11 take

    your cow
    For fines as they took your horse and

    plough
    A nd the bed from under you  Even so
    She said   they are cruel as death I know

    Then on they passed in the waning day
    Through Seabrook woods a weariful way
    By great salt meadows and sandhills bare
    And glimpses of blue sea here and there

    By the meetinghouse in Salisbury town
    The sufferers stood in the red sundown
    Bare for the lash  O pitying Night
    Drop swift thy curtain and hide the sight

    With shame in his eye and wrath on his lip
    The Salisbury constable dropped his whip

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    This warrant means murder foul and red
    Cursed is he who serves it he said

    Show me the order and meanwhile strike
    A blow at yovir peril   said Justice Pike
    Of all the rulers the land possessed
    Wisest and boldest was he and best

    He scoffed at witchcraft  the priest he met
    As man meets man  his feet he set
    Beyond liis dark age standing upright
    Soulfree with his face to the morning light

    He read the warrant   These convey
    From our precincts  at every town on the way
    Give each ten lashes God judge the

    brute
    I tread his order under my foot

    Cut loose these poor ones and let them

    go
    Come what will of it all men shall know
    No warrant is good though backed by the

    Crown
    For whipping women in Salisbury town

    The hearts of the villagers half released
    From creed of terror and rule of priest
    By a primal instinct owned the right
    Of human pity in laws despite

    For ruth and chivalry only slept
    His Saxon manhood the yeoman kept
    Quicker or slower the same blood ran
    In the Cavalier and the Puritan

    The Quakers sank on their knees in praise
    And thanks A last low sunset blaze
    Flashed out from under a cloud and shed
    A golden glory on each bowed head

    The tale is one of an evil time

    When souls were fettered and thought was

    crime
    And heresys whisper above its breath
    Meant shameful scourging and bonds and

    death

    What marvel that hunted and sorely tried
    Even woman rebuked and prophesied
    And soft words rarely answered back
    The grim persuasion of whip and rack

    If her cry from the whippingpost and jail
    Pierced sharp as the Kenites driven nail



    O woman at ease in these happier days
    Forbear to judge of thy sisters ways

    How much thy beautiful life may owe

    To her faith and courage thou canst not
    know

    Nor how from the paths of thy calm re
    treat

    She smoothed the thorns with her bleeding
    feet



    SAINT GREGORYS GUEST

    A TALE for Roman guides to tell

    To careless sightworn travellers still

    Who pause beside the narrow cell
    Of Gregory on the Cselian HUl

    One day before the monks door came
    A beggar stretching empty palms

    Fainting and fastsick in the name
    Of the Most Holy asking alms

    And the monk answered  All I have
    In this poor cell of mine I give

    The silver cup my mother gave

    In Christs name take thou it and
    live

    Years passed  and called at last to bear
    The pastoral crook and keys of Rome

    The poor monk in Saint Peters chair
    Sat the crowned lord of Christendom

    Prepare a feast Saint Gregory cried
    And let twelve beggars sit thereat

    The beggars came and one beside
    An unknown stranger with them sat

    I asked thee not the Pontiff spake
    O stranger  but if need be thine

    I bid thee welcome for the sake

    Of Him who is thy Lord and mine

    A grave calm face the stranger raised
    Like His who on Gennesaret trod

    Or His on whom the Chaldeans gazed
    Whose form was as the Son of God

    Knowst thou he said  thy gift of
    old

    And in tlie hand he lifted up
    The Pontiff marvelled to behold

    Once more his mothers silver cup

    Thy prayers aud alms have risen and
    bloom

    Sweetly among the flowers of heaven
    I am The Wonderful through whom

    Whateer thou askest shall be given

    He spake and vanished Gregory fell
    With his twelve guests in mute accord

    Prone on their faces knowing well
    Their eyes of flesh had seen the Lord

    The oldtime legend is not vain

    Nor vain thy art Veronas Paul
    Telling it oer and oer again

    On gray Vicenzas frescoed wall

    Still wheipsoever pity shares

    Its bread with sorrow want and sin

    And love the beggars feast prepares
    The uninvited Guest comes in

    Unheard because our ears are dull
    Unseen because our eyes are dim

    He walks our earth The Wonderful
    Aud all good deeds are done to Him



    BIRCHBROOK MILL

    A NOTELESS stream the Birchbrook runs

    Beneath its leaning trees
    That low soft ripple is its own

    That dull roar is the seas

    Of human signs it sees alone
    The distant church spires tip

    And ghostlike on a blank of gray
    The white sail of a ship

    No more a toiler at the wheel

    It wanders at its will
    Nor dam nor pond is left to tell

    Where once was Birchbrook mill

    The timbers of that mill have fed

    Long since a farmers fires
    His doorsteps are the stones that ground

    The harvest of his sires

    Man trespassed here  but Nature lost

    No riglit of her domain
    She waited and she brought the old

    Wild beauty back again



    By day the sunlight through the leaves
    Falls on its moist green sod

    And wakes the violet bloom of spring
    And autumns goldenrod

    Its birches whisper to the wind

    The swallow dips her wings
    In the cool spray and on its banks

    The gray songsparrow sings

    But from it when the dark night falls
    The schoolgirl shrinks with dread

    The farmer homebound from his fields
    Goes by with quickened tread

    They dare not pause to hear the grind
    Of shadowy stone on stone

    The plashing of a waterwheel
    Where wheel there now is none

    Has not a cry of pain been heard

    Above the clattering mill
    The pawing of an unseen horse

    Who waits his mistress still

    Yet never to the listeneis eye
    Has sight confirmed the sound

    A wavering birch line marks alone
    The vacant pasture ground

    No ghostly arms fling up to heaven

    The agony of prayer
    No spectral steed impatient shakes

    His white mane on the air

    The meaning of that common dread

    No tongue has fitly told
    The secret of the dark surmise

    The brook and birches hold

    What nameless horror of the past

    Broods here forevermore
    What ghost his unforgiven sin

    Is grinding oer and oer

    Does then immortal memory play

    The actors tragic part
    Rehearsals of a mortal life

    And unveiled human heart

    Gods pity spare a guilty soul

    That drama of its ill
    And let the scenic curtain fall

    On Birchbrooks haunted mill

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    THE TWO ELIZABETHS

    Read at the unveiling of the bust of Elizabeth
    Fry at the Friends School Providence R I

    A D 1209

    Amidst Thuringias wooded hills she dwelt
    A highborn princess servant of the poor
    Sweetening with gracious words the food
    she dealt
    To starving throngs at Wartburgs bla
    zoned door

    A blinded zealot held her soul in chains
    Cramped the sweet nature that he could
    not kill
    Scarred her fair body with his penance
    pains
    And gauged her conscience by his narrow
    will

    God gave her gifts of beauty and of grace
    With fast and vigil she denied them all

    Unquestioning with sad pathetic face
    She followed meekly at her stern guides
    call

    So drooped and died her homeblown rose
    of bliss
    In the chill rigor of a discipline
    That turned her fond lips from her chil
    drens kiss
    And made her joy of motherhood a sin

    To their sad level by compassion led

    One with the low and vile herself she
    made
    While thankless misery mocked the hand
    that fed
    And lauglied to scorn her piteous mas
    querade

    But still with patience that outwearied
    hate
    She gave her all wliile yet she had to
    give
    And then her empty hands importunate
    In prayer she lifted that the poor might
    live

    Sore pressed by grief and wrongs more
    hard to bear
    And dwarfed and stifled by a harsh con
    trol



    She kept life fragrant with good deeds and
    prayer
    And fresh and pure the white flower of
    her soul

    Death found her hnsj at her task  one
    word
    Alone she uttered as she paused to die
    Silence    then listened even as one
    who heard
    With song and wing the angels drawing
    nigh

    Now Fra Angelicos roses fill her hands
    And on Murillos canvas Want and
    Pain
    Kneel at her feet Her marble image
    stands
    Worshipped and crowned in Marburgs
    holy fane

    Yea wheresoeer her Church its cross up
    rears
    Wide as the world her story still is told
    In manhoods reverence womans prayers
    and tears
    She lives again whose grave is centuries
    old

    And still despite the weakness or the blame
    Of blind submission to the blind she
    hath
    A tender place in hearts of every name
    And more than Rome owns Saint Eliza
    beth

    A D 1780

    Slow ages passed  and lo  another came
    An English matron in whose simple faith

    Nor priestly rule nor ritual had claim
    A plain uncanonized Elizabeth

    No sackcloth robe nor ashen  sprinkled
    hair
    Nor wasting fast nor scourge nor vigil
    long
    Marred lier calm presence God had made
    her fair
    And slie could do His goodly work no
    wrong

    Their yoke is easy and their burden light
    Whose sole confessor is the Christ of
    God



    THE HOMESTEAD



    135



    Her quiet trust aud faith transcending
    sight
    Smoothed to her feet the difficult paths
    she trod

    And there she walked as duty bade her
    go
    Safe and unsullied as a cloistered nun
    Shamed with her plainness Fashions gaudy
    show
    And overcame the world she did not
    shun

    In Earlhams bowers in Plashets liberal
    hall
    In the great citys restless crowd and
    din
    Her ear was open to the Masters call
    And knew the summons of His voice
    within

    Tender as mother beautiful as wife

    Amidst the throngs of prisoned crime
    she stood
    In modest raiment faultless as her life
    The type of Englands worthiest woman
    hood

    To melt the hearts that harshness turned to

    stone

    The sweet persuasion of her lips sufficed

    Aud guilt which only hate and fear had

    known

    Saw in her own the pitying love of Christ

    So wheresoeer the guiding Spirit went
    She followed finding every prison cell

    It opened for her sacred as a teut

    Pitched by Gennesaret or by Jacobs well

    And Pride and Fashion felt her strong ap
    peal
    And priest and ruler marvelled as they
    saw
    How hand in hand went wisdom with her
    zeal
    And womans pity kept the bounds of
    law

    She rests in Gods peace  but her memory

    stirs

    The air of earth as with an angels wings

    And warms and moves the hearts of men

    like hers

    The sainted daughter of Hungarian kings



    United now the Briton and the Hun
    Each in her own time faithful unto
    death

    Live sister souls  in name and spirit one
    Thurinjjias saint and our Elizabeth



    REQUITAL

    As Islams Prophet when his last day drew
    Nigh to its close besought all men to

    say
    Whom he had wronged to whom he then
    should pay
    A debt forgotten or for pardon sue
    And through the silence of his weeping
    friends
    A strange voice cried   Thou owest me

    a debt
    Allah be praised   he answered
    Even yet
    He gives me power to make to thee amends
    O friend  I thank thee for thy timely
    word
    So runs the tale Its lesson all may

    heed
    For all have sinned in thought or word
    or deed
    Or like the Prophet through neglect have

    erred
    All need forgiveness all have debts to pay
    Ere the night cometh while it still is day



    THE HOMESTEAD

    Against the wooded hills it stands
    Ghost of a dead home staring through

    Its broken lights on wasted lands
    Where oldtime harvests grew

    Unploughed unsown by scythe unshorn
    The poor forsaken farmfields lie

    Once rich and rife with golden corn
    And pale green breadths of rye

    Of healthful herb and flower bereft
    The garden plot no housewife keeps

    Througii weeds and tangle only left
    The snake its tenant creeps

    A lilac spray still blossomclad

    Sways slow before the emptj rooms

    Beside the roofless porch a sad
    Pathetic red rose blooms

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    His track in mould and dust of drouth
    On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves

    And in the fireless chimneys mouth
    His web the spider weaves

    The leaning barn about to fall

    Resounds no more on husking eves

    No cattle low in yard or stall
    No thresher beats his sheaves

    So sad so drear  It seems almost

    Some haunting Presence makes its sign

    That down yon shadowy lane some ghost
    Might drive his spectral kine

    O home so desolate and lorn

    Did all thy memories die with thee
    Were any wed were any born

    Beneath this low rooftree

    Whose axe the wall of forest broke
    And let the waiting sunshine through

    What goodwife sent the earliest smoke
    Up the great chimney flue

    Did rustic lovers hither come

    Did maidens swaying back and forth
    In rhythmic grace at wheel and loom

    Make light their toil with mirth

    Did child feet patter on the stair

    Did boyhood frolic in the snow
    Did gray age in her elbow chair

    Knit rocking to and fro

    The murmuring brook the sighing breeze
    The pines slow whisper cannot tell

    Low mounds beneath the liemlocktrees
    Keep the home secrets well

    Cease motherland to fondly boast
    Of sons far off who strive and thrive

    Forgetful that each swarming host
    Must leave an emptier hive

    O wanderers from ancestral soil

    Leave noisome mill and chaffering store

    Gird up your loins for sturdier toil
    And build the home once more

    Come back to bayberryscented slopes
    And fragrant fern and groundnut vine

    Breathe airs blown over holt and copse
    Sweet with black birch and pine



    What matter if the gains are small
    That lifes essential wants supply

    Your homesteads title gives you all
    That idle wealth can buy

    All that the manydollared crave

    The brickwalled slaves of Change and
    mart
    Lawns trees fresh air and flowers you
    have
    More dear for lack of art

    Your own sole masters freedomwilled
    With none to bid you go or stay

    Till the old fields your fathers tilled
    As manly men as they

    With skill that spares your toiling hands
    And chemic aid that science brings

    Reclaim the waste and outworn lands
    And reign thereon as kings



    HOW THE ROBIN CAME

    AN ALGONQUIN LEGEND

    Happy young friends sit by me
    Under Mays blown appletree
    While these homebirds in and out
    Througli the blossoms flit about
    Hear a story strange and old
    By the wild red Indians told
    How the robin came to be
    Once a great chief left his son
    Wellbeloved his only one
    When the boy was wellnigh grown
    In the triallodge alone
    Left for tortures long and slow
    Youths like him must undergo
    Who their pride of manhood test
    Lacking water food and rest

    Seven days the fast he kept

    Seven nights he never slept

    Then the young boy wrung with pain

    Weak from natures overstrain

    Faltering moaned a low complaint

    Spare me father for I faint

    But the chieftain haughtyeyed

    Hid his pity in his pride

    You shall be a hunter good

    Knowing never lack of food

    You shall be a warrior great
    Wise as fox and strong as bear
    Many scalps your belt sliall wear
    If with patient heart you wait
    Bravely till your task is done
    Better you should starving die
    Thau that boy and squaw should cry
    Shame upon your fathers sou

    When next morn the suns first rays
    Glistened on the hemlock sprays
    Straight that lodge the old chief sought
    Aud boiled samp and moose meat

    brought
    Rise and eat my son   he said
    Lo he found the poor boy dead
    As with grief his grave they made
    And his bow beside him laid
    Pipe and knife and wampumbraid
    On the lodgetop overhead
    Preening smooth its breast of red
    And the brown coat that it wore
    Sat a bird unknown before
    And as if with human tongue
    Mourn me not it said or sung
    I a bird am still your son
    Happier than if hunter fleet
    Or a brave before your feet
    Laying scalps in battle won
    Friend of man my song shall cheer
    Lodge and cornland  hovering near
    To each wigwam I shall bring
    Tidings of the coming spring
    Every child my voice shall know
    In the moon of melting snow
    When the maples red bud swells
    And the windflower lifts its bells
    As their fond companion
    Men shall henceforth own your son
    And my song shall testify
    That of human kin am I

    Thus the Indian legend saith
    How at first the robin came
    With a sweeter life than death
    Bird for boy and still the same
    If my young friends doubt that this
    Is the robins genesis
    Not in vain is still the myth
    If a truth be found therewith
    Unto gentleness belong
    Gifts unknown to pride and wrong
    Happier far than hate is praise
    He who sings than he who slays

    On a painting by E A Abbey The Gen

    1658 that  any person or persons of the cursed

    Over the threshold of his pleasant home

    They left behind them more than home or

    With ravening wolves than those whose

    Round stormvexed capes whose teeth of

    The waves to foam their perilous way

    THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN

    The hint of this ballad is found in Arndts
    Murchen Berlin 1816 The ballad appeared
    first in St Nicholas whose young readers were
    advised while smiling at the absiud supersti
    tion to remember that bad companionsliii and
    evil habits desires and passions are more to
    be dreaded now than the Elves and Trolls who
    frightened the children of past ages

    The pleasant isle of Riigen looks the Baltic
    water oer

    To the silversanded beaches of the Pom
    eranian shore

    And in the town of Rambiu a little boy and

    maid
    Plucked the meadowflowers together and

    in the seasurf played

    Alike were they in beauty if not in their
    degree

    He was the Amptmans firstborn the mil
    lers child was she

    Now of old the isle of Riigen was full of

    Dwarfs and Trolls
    The brownfaced little Earthmen tlie

    people without souls

    And for every man and woman in Riigens

    island found
    Walking in air and sunshine a Troll was

    underground

    It chanced the little maiden one morning

    strolled away
    Among tlie haunted Nine Hills where the

    elves and goblins play

    That day In barley fields below the har
    vesters had known

    Of evil voices in the air aud heard the
    small horns blown

    She came not back  the search for her in

    field and wood was vain
    They cried her east they cried her west

    but she came not again

    She s down among the Brown Dwarfs
    said the dreamwives wise and old

    And prayers were made and masses said
    and Rarabins church bell tolled



    THE BROWN DWARF OF RUGEN



    139



    Five years her father mourned her  and

    then John Deitrich said
    I will find my little playmate be she

    alive or dead



    He



    he



    watched among the Nine Hills
    heard the Brown Dwarfs sing
    And saw them dance by moonlight merrily
    in a ring

    And when their gayrobed leader tossed up

    liis cap of red
    Young Deitrich caught it as it fell and

    thrust it on his head

    The Troll came crouching at his feet and

    wept for lack of it
    Oh give me back my magic cap for your

    great head unfit

    Nay Deitrich said   the Dwarf who
    tluows his charmed cap away

    Must serve its finder at his will and for
    his folly pay

    You stole my pretty Lisbeth and hid her

    in the earth
    And you shall ope the door of glass and let

    me lead her forth

    She will not come  she s one of us  she s
    mine   the Brown Dwarf said

    The day is set the cake is baked tomor
    row we shall wed

    The fell fiend fetch thee   Deitrich cried
    and keep thy foul tongue still

    Quick  open to thy evil world the glass
    door of the hill

    The Dwarf obeyed  and youth and Troll
    down the long stairway passed

    And saw in dim and sunless light a country
    strange and vast

    Weird rich and wonderful he saw the

    elfin underland
    Its palaces of precious stones its streets of

    goldeu sand

    He came unto a banquethall with tables

    richly spread
    Where a young maiden served to him the

    red wine and the bread



    How fair she seemed among the Trolls so

    ugly and so wild
    Yet pale and very sorrowful like one who

    never smiled

    Her low sweet voice her goldbrown hair
    her tender blue eyes seemed

    Like something he had seen elsewhere or
    something he had dreamed

    He looked  he clasped her in his arms  he

    knew the longlost one
    O Lisbeth  See thy playmate  I am the

    Amptmans son

    She leaned her fair head on his breast and
    through her sobs she spoke

    Oh take me from this evil place and
    from the elfin folk

    And let me tread the grassgreen fields
    and smell the flowers again

    And feel the soft wind on my cheek and
    hear the dropping rain

    And oh to hear the singing bird the

    rustling of the tiee
    The lowing cows the bleat of sheep the

    voices of the sea

    And oh upon my fathers knee to sit be
    side the door

    And hear the bell of vespers ring in Ram
    bin church once more

    He kissed her cheek he kissed her lips

    the Brown Dwarf groaiied to see
    And tore his tangled hair and ground his

    long teeth angrily

    But Deitrich said   For five long years
    this tender Christian maid

    Has served yon in your evil world and well
    must she be paid

    Haste   hither bring me precious gems
    the richest in your store

    Then when we pass tlie gate of glass you 11
    take your cap once more

    No choice was left the baffled Troll and

    murmuring he obeyed
    And filled the pockets of the youth and

    apron of the maid

    NARRATIVE AND LEGENDARY POEMS



    They left the dreadful underland and

    passed the gate of glass
    They felt the sunshiues warm caress they

    trod the soft green grass

    And when beneath they saw the Dwarf
    stretch up to them his brown

    And crooked clawlike fingers they tossed
    his red cap down

    Oh never shone so bright a sun was never

    sky so blue
    As hand in hand they homeward walked

    the pleasant meadows through

    And never sang the birds so sweet in Ram
    bins woods before

    And never washed the waves so soft along
    the Baltic shore

    And when beneath his dooryard trees the

    father met his child
    The bells rung out their merriest peal the

    folks with joy ran wild



    And soon from Rambins holy church the
    twain came forth as one

    The Amptman kissed a daughter the mil
    ler blest a son

    John Deitrichs fame went far and wide
    and nurse and maid crooned oer

    Their cradle song   Sleep on sleep well
    the Trolls shall come no more

    For in the haunted Nine Hills he set a

    cross of stone
    And Elf and Brown Dwarf sought in vain

    a door where door was none

    The tower he built in Rambin fair Rtigens
    pride and boast

    Looked oer the Baltic water to the Pome
    ranian coast

    And for his worth ennobled and rich be
    yond compare

    Count Deitrich and his lovely bride dwelt
    long and happy there

    THE FROST SPIRIT

    He comes  he comes  the Frost Spirit
    comes  You may trace his foot
    steps now

    On the naked woods and the blasted fields
    and the brown hills withered brow

    He has smitten the leaves of the gray old
    trees where their pleasant green
    came fortli

    And the winds which follow wherever he
    goes have shaken them down to
    earth

    He comes  he comes  the Frost Spirit

    comes  from the frozen Labrador
    From the icy bridge of the Northern seas

    which the white bear wanders oer
    Where the fishermans sail is stiff with ice

    and the luckless forms below
    In the sunless cold of the lingering night

    into marble statues grow

    He comes  he comes  the Frost Spirit

    comes  on the rushing Northern

    blast
    And the dark Norwegian pines have bowed

    as his fearful breath went past
    With an unscorched wing he has hurried on

    where the fires of Hecla glow
    On the darkly beautiful sky above and the

    ancient ice below

    He comes  he comes  the Frost Spirit

    comes  and the quiet lake shall feel
    The torpid touch of his glazing breath and

    ring to the skaters heel
    And the streams which danced on the

    broken rocks or sang to the leaning

    grass
    Shall bow again to their winter chain and

    in mournful silence pass

    He comes  he comes  tlie Frost Spirit
    comes  Let us meet hiui as we may



    And turn with the light of the parlorfire

    his evil power away
    And gather closer the circle round when

    that firelight dances high
    And laugh at the shriek of the baffled Fiend

    as his sounding wing goes by

    SlEUR DE MONTS 1604

    Stream of my fathers  sweetly still

    The sunset rays thy valley fill

    Poured slantwise down the long defile

    Wave wood and spire beneath them smile

    I see the winding Powow fold

    The green hill in its belt of gold

    And following down its wavy line

    Its sparkling waters blend with thine

    There s not a tree upon thy side

    Nor rock which thy returning tide

    As yet hath left abrupt and stark

    Above thy evening watermark

    No calm cove with its rocky hem

    No isle whose emerald swells begem

    Thy broad smooth current  not a sail

    Bowed to the freshening ocean gale

    No small boat with its busy oars

    Nor gray wall sloping to thy shores

    Nor farmhouse with its majjle shade

    Or rigid poplar colonnade

    But lies distinct and full in sight

    Beneath this gush of sunset light

    Centuries ago that harborbar

    Stretching its length of foam afar

    And Salisburys beach of shining sand

    And yonder islands wavesmoothed strand

    Saw the adventurers tiny sail

    Flit stooping from the eastern gale

    And oer these woods and waters broke

    The clieer from Britains hearts of oak

    As brightly on the voyagers eye

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Weary of forest sea and sky

    Breaking the dull continuous wood

    The IMerriniac rolled down his Hood

    Mingling that clear pellucid brook

    Which channels vast Agioochook

    When springtimes sun and shower unlock

    The frozen fountains of the rock

    And more abundant waters given

    From that pure lake  The Smile of

    Heaven
    Tributes from vale and mountainside
    With oceans dark eternal tide

    On yonder rocky cape which braves
    The stormy challenge of the waves
    Midst tangled vine and dwarfish wood
    The hardy AngloSaxon stood
    Plantuig upon the topmost crag
    The staff of Englands battleflag
    And while from out its heavy fold
    Saint Georges crimson cross mirolled
    Midst roll of drum and trumpet blare
    And weapons brandishing in air
    He gave to that lone promontory
    The sweetest name in all his story
    Of her the flower of Islams daughters
    Whose harems look on Stambouls wa
    ters
    Who when the chance of war had bound
    The Moslem chain his limbs aromid
    Wreathed oer with silk that iron chain
    Soothed with her smiles his hours of pain
    And fondly to her youthful slave
    A dearer gift than freedom gave

    But look  the yellow light no more
    Streams down on wave and verdant shore
    And clearly on the calm air swells
    The twilight voice of distant bells
    From Oceans bosom white and thin
    The mists come slowly rolling in
    Hills woods the rivers rocky rim
    Amidst the sealike vapor swim
    While yonder lonely coastlight set
    Witiiin its wavewashed minaret
    Half quenched a beamless star and pale
    Shines dimly through its cloudy veil

    Home of my fathers   I have stood
    Where Hudson rolled his lordly flood
    Seen sunrise rest and sunset fade
    Along his frowning Palisade
    Looked down the Appalachian peak
    On Juniatas silver streak
    Have seen along his valley gleam



    The Mohawks softly winding stream
    The level light of sunset shine
    Through broad Potomacs hem of pine
    And autumns rainbowtinted banner
    Hang lightly oer the Susquehanna
    Yet wheresoeer his step might be
    Thy wandering child looked back to thee
    Heard in his dreams thy rivers sound
    Of murmuring on its pebbly bound
    The unforgotten swell and roar
    Of waves on thy familiar shore
    And saw amidst the curtained gloom
    And quiet of his lonely room
    Thy sunset scenes before him pass
    As in Agrippas magic glass
    The loved and lost arose to view
    Remejnbered groves in greenness grew
    Bathed still in childhoods morning dew
    Along whose bowers of beauty swept
    Whatever Memorys mourners wept
    Sweet faces which the charnel kept
    Young gentle eyes which long had slept
    And while the gazer leaned to trace
    More near some dear familiar face
    He wept to find the vision flown
    A phantom and a dream alone



    HAMPTON BEACH

    The sunlight glitters keen and bright

    Where miles away
    Lies stretching to my dazzled sight
    A luminous belt a misty light
    Beyond the dark pine bluffs and wastes of
    sandy gray

    The tremulous shadow of the Sea

    Against its ground
    Of silvery light rock hill and tree
    Still as a picture clear and fiee
    With varying outline mark the coast for
    miles around

    On  on  we tread with looseflung rein

    Our seaward way
    Through darkgreen fields and blossom
    ing grain
    Where the wild brierrose skirts the lane
    And bends above our heads the flowering
    locust spray

    Ha  like a kind hand on my brow

    Conies this fresh breeze
    Cooling its dull and feverish glow



    A DREAM OF SUMMER



    M3



    While through my being seems to flow
    The breath of a new life the healing of
    the seas

    Now rest we where this grassy tnound

    His feet hath set
    In the great waters which have bound
    His granite ankles greenly round
    With long and tangled moss and weeds
    with cool spray wet

    Goodby to Pain and Care  I take

    Mine ease today
    Here where these sunny waters break
    And ripples this keen breeze I shake
    All burdens from the heart all weary
    thoughts away

    I draw a freer breath I seem

    Like all I see
    Waves in the sun the whitewinged

    gleam
    Of seabirds in the slanting beam
    And faroff sails which flit before the south
    wind free

    So when Times veil shall fall asunder

    The soul may know
    No fearful change nor sudden wonder
    Nor sink the weight of mystery under
    But with the upward rise and with tlie
    vastness grow

    And all we slrrink from now may
    seem
    No new revealing
    Familiar as our childhoods stream
    Or pleasant memory of a dream
    The loved and cherisiied Past upon the
    new life stealing

    Serene and mild the untried light

    May have its dawning
    And as in svmimers northern night
    The evening and the dawn unite
    The sunset hues of Time blend with the
    souls new morning

    I sit alone  in foam and spray

    Wave after wave
    Breaks on the rocks which stern and

    gray
    Shoulder the broken tide away
    Or murmurs hoarse and strong through
    mossy cleft and cave



    What heed I of the dusty land

    And noisy town
    I see the mighty deep expand
    From its white line of glimmering sand
    To where the blue of heaven on bluer
    waves shuts down

    In listless quietude of mind

    I yield to all
    The change of cloud and wave and wind
    And passive on the flood reclined
    I wander with the waves and with them
    rise and fall

    But look thou dreamer  wave and shore

    In shadow lie
    The nightwind warns me back once more
    To where my native hilltops oer
    Bends like an arch of fire the glowing sun
    set sky

    So then beach bluff and wave farewell i

    I bear with me
    No token stone nor glittering shell
    But long and oft shall Memory tell
    Of this brief thoughtful hour of musing by
    the Sea



    A DREAM OF SUMMER

    Bland as the morning breath of June

    The southwest breezes play
    And through its haze the winter noon

    Seems warm as summers day
    The snowplumed Angel of the North

    Has dropped his icy spear
    Again the mossy earth looks forth

    Again the streams gush clear

    The fox his hillside cell forsakes

    The muskrat leaves his nook
    The bluebird in the meadow brakes

    Is singing with the brook
    Bear up O Mother Nature   cry

    Bird breeze and streamlet free
    Our winter voices prophesy

    Of summer days to thee

    So in those winters of the soul

    By bitter blasts and drear
    Oerswept from Memorys frozen pole

    Will sunny days appear
    Reviving Hope and Faith they show

    The soul its living powers

    POEMS OF NATURE



    And how beneath the winters snow
    Lie germs of summer flowers

    The Night is mother of the Day

    The Winter of the Spring
    And ever upon old Decay

    The greenest mosses cling
    Behind the cloud the starlight lurks

    Through showers the sunbeams fall
    For God who loveth all His works

    Has left His hope with all



    THE LAKESIDE

    The shadows round the inland sea

    Are deepening into night
    Slow up the slopes of Ossipee

    They chase the lessening light
    Tired of the long days blinding heat

    I rest my languid eye
    Lake of the Hills  where cool and sweet

    Thy sunset waters lie

    Along the sky in wavy lines

    Oer isle and reach and bay
    Greenbelted with eternal pines

    The mountains stretch away
    Below the maple masses sleep

    Where shore with water blends
    While midway on the tranquil deep

    The evening light descends

    So seemed it when yon hills red crown

    Of old the Indian trod
    And through the sunset air looked down

    Upon tlie Smile of God
    To him of light and shade the laws

    No forest skeptic taught
    Their living and eternal Cause

    His truer instinct sought

    He saw these mountains in the light

    Which now across them shines
    This lake in summer sunset bright

    Walled round with sombering pines
    God near him seemed  from earth and
    skies

    His loving voice he heard
    As face to face in Paradise

    Man stood before the Lord

    Thanks O our Father  that like him

    Thy tender love I see
    In radiant hill and woodland dim



    And tinted sunset sea
    For not in mockery dost Thou fill

    Our earth with light and grace
    Thou hidst no dark and cruel will

    Behind Thy smiling face



    AUTUMN THOUGHTS

    Gone hath the Spring with all its flowers
    And gone the Summers pomp and
    show

    And Autumn in his leafless bowers
    Is waiting for the Winters snow

    I said to Earth so cold and gray
    An emblem of myself thou art

    Not so the Earth did seem to say
    For Spring shall warm my frozen
    heart

    I soothe my wintry sleep with dreams
    Of warmer sun and softer rain

    And wait to hear the sound of streams
    And songs of merry birds again

    But thou from whom the Spring hath
    gone

    For whom the flowers no longer blow
    Who standest blighted and forlorn

    Like Autumn waiting for the snow

    No hope is thine of sunnier hours
    Thy Winter shall no more depart

    No Sjpring revive thy wasted flowers
    Nor Summer warm thy frozen heart



    ON RECEIVING AN EAGLES
    QUILL FROM LAKE SUPERIOR

    All day the darkness and the cold

    Upon my heart have lain
    Like shadows on the winter sky

    Like frost upon the pane

    But now my torpid fancy wakes
    And on thy Eagles plume

    Rides forth like Sindbad on his bird
    Or witch upon her broom

    Below me roar the rocking pines
    Before me spreads tlie lake

    Whose long and solemnsounding waves
    Against the sunset break

    I hear the wild RiceEater thresh


    The snowy cones of Oregon


    The grain he has not sown


    Are kindling on its way


    I see with flashing scythe of fire


    And Californias golden sands


    The prairie harvest mown


    Gleam brighter in its ray


    I hear the faroff voyagers horn


    Then blessings on thy eagle quill


    I see the Yankees trail


    As wandering far and wide


    His foot on every mountauipass


    I thank thee for this twilight dream


    On every stream his sail


    And Fancys airy ride


    By forest lake and waterfall


    Yet welcomer than regal plumes


    I see his pedler show


    Which Western trappers find


    The mighty mingling with the mean


    Thy free and pleasant thoughts chance


    The lofty with the low


    sown




    Like feathers on the wind


    He s whittling by St Marys Falls

    Thy symbol be the mountainbird


    He s measuring oer the Pictured Rocks


    Whose glistening quill I hold


    With eager eyes of gain


    Thy home the ample air of hope




    And memorys sunset gold


    I hear the mattock in the mine




    The axestroke in the dell


    In thee let joy with duty join


    The clamor from the Indian lodge


    And strength unite with love


    The Jesuit chapel bell


    The eagles pinions folding round




    The warm heart of the dove


    I see the swarthy trappers come




    From Mississippis springs


    So when in darkness sleeps the vale


    And warchiefs with their painted brows


    Where still the blind bird clings


    And crests of eagle wings


    The sunshine of the upper sky




    Shall glitter on thy wings


    Behind the scared squaws birch canoe




    The steamer smokes and raves

    The first low wash of waves where soon


    a bird

    In the windshaken elm or the maple is

    The rudiments of empire here


    For green meadowgrasses wide levels of

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Round the boles of the pinewood the

    groundlaurel creeps
    Unkissed of the simshiue unbaptized of

    showers
    With buds scarcely swelled which should

    burst into flowers
    We wait for thy coming sweet wind of the

    south
    For the touch of thy light wings the kiss

    of thy mouth
    For the yearly evangel thou bearest from

    God
    Resurrection and life to the graves of the

    sod
    Up our long rivervalley for days have not

    ceased
    The wail and the shriek of the bitter north
    east
    Raw and chill as if winnowed through ices

    and snow
    All the way from the land of the wild Es
    quimau
    Until all our dreams of the land of the blest
    Like that red hunters turn to the sunny

    southwest
    O soul of the springtime its light and its

    breath
    Bring warmth to this coldness bring life to

    this death
    Renew the great miracle  let us behold
    The stone from the mouth of the sepulchre

    rolled
    And Nature like Lazarus rise as of old
    Let our faith which in darkness and cold
    ness has lain
    Revive with the warmth and the brightness

    again
    And in blooming of flower and budding of

    tree
    The symbols and types of our destiny see
    The life of the springtime the life of the

    whole
    And as sun to the sleeping earth love to

    the soul

    PICTURES
    I

    Light warmth and sprouting greenness
    and oer all
    Blue stainless steelbright ether raining

    down
    Tranquillity upon the deephushed town
    The freshening meadows and the hill
    sides brown



    Voice of the westwind from the hills
    of pine
    And the brimmed river from its distant fall
    Low hum of bees and joyous interlude
    Of birdsongs in the streamletskirting

    wood
    Heralds and prophecies of sound and

    sight
    Blessed forerunners of the warmth and
    light
    Attendant angels to the house of prayer
    With reverent footsteps keeping pace
    with mine
    Once more through Gods great love with

    you I share
    A morn of resiurection sweet and fair

    As that which saw of old in Palestine
    Immortal Love uprising in fresh bloom
    From the dark night and winter of the
    tomb



    White with its sunbleached dust the path
    way winds
    Before me  dust is on the shrunken grass
    And on the trees beneath whose boughs

    I pass
    Frail screen against the Himter of the

    sky
    Who glaring on me with his lidless eye
    While mounting with his dogstar high
    and higher
    Ambushed in light intolerable unbinds

    The bmnished quiver of his shafts of
    fire
    Between me and the hot fields of his

    South
    A tremulous glow as from a furnace
    mouth
    Glimmers and swims before my dazzled
    sight
    As if the burning arrows of his ire
    Broke as they fell and shattered into
    light
    Yet on my cheek I feel the western wind
    And hear it telling to the orchard trees
    And to the faint and flowerforsaken bees
    Tales of fair meadows green with con
    stant streams
    And mountains risuig blue and cool beliind
    Where in moist dells the purple orchis
    gleams
    And starred with white the virgins bower

    is twined
    So the oerwearied pilgrim as he fares



    SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE



    147



    Along lifes summer waste at times is
    fanned
    Even at noontide by the cool sweet airs
    Of a serener and a holier land
    Fresh as the morn and as the dewfall
    bland
    Breath of the blessed Heaven for which

    we pray
    Blow from the eternal hills  make glad
    our earthly way



    SUMMER BY THE LAKESIDE

    LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE
    I NOON

    White clouds whose shadows haunt the

    deep
    Light mists whose soft embraces keep
    The sunshine on the hills asleep

    O isles of calm  O dark still wood
    And stiller skies that overbrood
    Your rest with deeper quietude

    shapes and hues dim beckoning through
    Yon mountain gaps my longing view
    Beyond the purple and the blue

    To stiller sea and greener land

    And softer lights and airs more bland

    And skies  the hollow of Gods hand

    Transfused through you O mountain

    friends
    With mine your solemn spirit blends
    And life no more hath separate ends

    1 read each misty mountain sign

    I know the voice of wave and pine
    And I am yours and ye are mine

    Lifes burdens fall its discords cease

    I lapse into the glad release

    Of Natures own exceeding peace

    O welcome calm of heart and mind
    As falls yon fiitrees loosened rind
    To leave a tenderer growth behind

    So fall the weary years away
    A child again my head I lay
    Upon the lap of this sweet day



    This western wind hath Lethean powers
    Yon noonday cloud nepenthe showers
    The lake is white with lotusflowers

    Even Dutys voice is faint and low

    And slumberous Conscience waking slow

    Forgets her blotted scroll to show

    The Shadow which pursues us all
    Whose evernearing steps appall
    Whose voice we hear behind us call

    That Shadow blends with moimtain gray
    It speaks but what the light waves say
    Death walks apart from Fear today

    Rocked on her breast these pines and I
    Alike on Natures love rely
    And equal seems to live or die

    Assured that He whose presence fills
    With light the spaces of these hills
    No evil to His creatures wills

    The simple faith remains that He
    Will do whatever that may be
    The best alike for man and tree

    What mosses over one shall grow
    What light and life the other know
    Unanxious leaving Him to show

    II EVENING

    Yon mountains side is black with night
    While broadorbed oer its gleaming
    crown

    The moon slowrounding into sight
    On tlie hushed inland sea looks down

    How start to light the clustering isles
    Each silver  hemmed  How sharply
    show

    The shadows of their rocky piles
    And treetops in the wave below

    How far and strange the mountains seem
    Dimlooming through the pale still light

    The vague vast grouping of a dream
    They stretch into the solemn night

    Beneath lake wood and peopled vale
    Hushed by that presence grand and grave

    Are silent save the crickets wail
    And low response of leaf and wave

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Fair scenes  whereto the Day and Night
    Make rival love I leave ye soon

    What time before the eastern light
    The pale ghost of the setting moon

    Shall hide behind yon rocky spines

    And the young archer Morn shall break

    His arrows on the mountain pines

    And goldensandalled walk the lake

    Farewell  around this smiling bay

    Gayhearted Health and Life in bloom

    With lighter steps than mine may stray
    In radiant summers yet to come

    But none shall more regretful leave
    These waters and these hills than I

    Or distant fonder dream how eve
    Or dawn is painting wave and sky

    How rising moons shine sad and mild
    On wooded isle and silvering bay

    Or setting suns beyond the piled
    And purple mountains lead the day

    Nor laughing girl nor bearding boy

    Nor fullpulsed manhood lingering here

    Shall add to lifes abounding joy

    The charmed repose to suffering dear

    Still waits kind Nature to impart
    Her choicest gifts to such as gain

    An entrance to her loving heart

    Through the sharp discipline of pain

    Forever from the Hand that takes
    One blessing from us others fall

    And soon or late our Father makes
    His perfect recompense to all

    Oh watched by Silence and the Night
    And folded in the strong embrace

    Of the great mountains witli the light
    Of the sweet heavens upon thy face

    Lake of the Northland  keep thy dower
    Of beauty still and while above

    Thy solemn mountains speak of power
    Be thou the mirror of Gods love



    THE FRUITGIFT

    Last night just as the tints of autumns sky
    Of sunset faded from our hills and
    streams



    I sat vague listening lapped in twilight

    dreams
    To the leafs rustle and the crickets cry
    Then like that basket flush with summer

    fruit
    Dropped by the angels at the Prophets

    foot
    Came unannounced a gift of clustered

    sweetness
    Fullorbed and glowing with the prisoned

    beams
    Of summery suns and rounded to com
    pleteness
    By kisses of the southwind and the dew
    Thrilled with a glad surprise methought I

    knew
    The pleasure of the homewardturning

    Jew
    When Eshcols clusters on his shoulders

    lay
    Dropping their sweetness on his desert way

    I said  This fruit beseems no world of
    sin
    Its parent vine rooted in Paradise
    Oercrept the wall and never paid the

    price
    Of the great mischief  an ambrosial
    tree
    Edens exotic somehow smuggled in

    To keep the thorns and thistles company
    Perchance our frail sad mother plucked in
    haste
    A single vineslip as she passed the gate
    Where the dread sword alternate paled
    and burned
    And the stern angel pitying her fate
    Forgave the lovely trespasser and turned
    Aside his face of fire  and thus the waste
    And fallen world hath yet its annual taste
    Of primal good to prove of sin the cost
    And show by one gleaned ear the mighty
    harvest lost



    FLOWERS IN WINTER

    PAINTED UPON A PORTE LIVRE

    How strange to greet this frosty morn
    In graceful counterfeit of Howers

    These children of the meadows born
    Of sunshine and of showers

    How well the conscious wood retains
    The pictures of its flowersown home



    THE MAYFLOWERS



    149



    The lights and shades the purple stains
    And golden hues of bloom

    It was a happy thought to bring
    To the dark seasons frost and rime

    This painted memory of spring
    This dream of summertime

    Our hearts are lighter for its sake
    Our fancys age renews its youth

    And dimremembered fictions take
    The giuse of present truth

    A wizard of the Merrimac
    So old ancestral legends say

    Could call green leaf and blossom back
    To frosted stem and spray

    The dry logs of the cottage wall

    Beneath his touch put out their leaves

    The claybound swallow at his call
    Played round the icy eaves

    The settler saw his oaken flail

    Take bud and bloom before his eyes j

    From frozen pools he saw the pale
    Sweet summer lilies rise

    To their old homes by man profaned
    Came the sad dryads exiled long

    And through their leafy tongues complained
    Of household use and wrong

    The beechen platter sprovited wild
    The pipkin wore its oldtime green

    The cradle oer the sleeping child
    Became a leafy screen

    Haply our gentle friend hath met
    While wandering in her sylvan quest

    HaTinting his native woodlands yet
    That Druid of the West

    And while the dew on leaf and flower
    Glistened in moonlight clear and still

    Learned the dusk wizards spell of power
    And caught his trick of skill

    But welcome be it new or old

    The gift which makes the day more bright
    And paints upon the ground of cold

    And darlcness warmth and light

    Without is neither gold nor green
    Within for birds the birchlogs sing



    Yet summerlike we sit between
    The autumn and the spring

    The one with bridal blush of rose

    And sweetest breath of woodland balm

    And one whose matron lips unclose
    In smiles of saintly calm

    Fill soft and deep O winter snow

    The sweet azaleas oaken dells
    And hide the bank where roses blow

    And swing the azure bells

    Oerlay the amber violets leaves
    The purple asters brookside home

    Guard all the flowers her pencil gives
    A life beyond their bloom

    And she when spring comes round again
    By greening slope and singing flood

    Shall wander seeking not in vain
    Her darlings of the wood



    THE MAYFLOWERS

    The trailing arbutus or mayflower grows
    abundantly in the vicinity of Plymoiith and
    was the first flower that greeted the Pilgrims
    after their fearful winter The name mayflower
    was familiar iu England as the application of
    it to the historic vessel shows but it was applied
    by the English and still is to the hawthorne
    Its use in New England in comiection with
    Epigcea repens dates from a very early day
    some claiming that the first Pilgrims so used
    it in afPectionate memory of the vessel and its
    English flower association

    Sad Mayflower  watched by winter stars

    And nursed by winter gales
    With petals of the sleeted spars

    And leaves of frozen sails

    What had she in those dreary hours

    Within her icerimmed bay
    In common with the wildwood flowers

    The first sweet smiles of May

    Yet  God be praised   the Pilgrim said

    nio saw the blossoms peer
    Above the brown leaves dry and dead

    Behold our Mayflower here

    God wills it  here our rest shall be
    Our years of wandering oer

    Shall spread her sails uo more

    O sacred flowers of faith aud hope

    As sweetly now as then
    Ye hlooin on many a bircheu slope

    In many a pinedark glen

    Behind the seawalls rugged length
    Unchanged your leaves unfold

    Like love behind the manly strength
    Of the brave hearts of old

    So live the fathers in their sons

    Their sturdy faith be ours
    And ours the love that overruns

    Its rocky strength with flowers

    The Pilgrims wild and wintry day

    Its shadow round us draws
    The Mayflower of his stormy bay

    Our Freedoms struggling cause

    But warmer suns erelong shall bring

    To life the frozen sod
    And through dead leaves of hope shall
    spring

    Afresh the flowers of God



    THE LAST WALK IN AUTUMN



    Oer the bare woods whose outstretched
    hands
    Plead with the leaden heavens in vain
    I see beyond the valley lands

    The seas long level dim with rain
    Around me all things stark and dumb
    Seem praying for the snows to come
    And for the summer bloom and greenness

    gone
    With winters sunset lights aud dazzling
    morn atone



    Along the rivers summer walk

    The withered tufts of asters nod
    And trembles on its arid stalk

    The hoar plume of the goldenrod
    And on a ground of sombre fir
    And azurestudded juniper
    The silver birch its buds of purple shows
    And scarlet berries tell where bloomed the
    sweet wildrose



    With mingled sound of horns and bells
    A farheard clang the wild geese fly

    Stormsent from Arctic moors and fells
    Like a great arrow through the sky

    Two dusky lines converged in one

    Chasing the southwardflyiug sun
    While the brave snowbird and the hardy

    Call to them from the pines as if to bid
    them stay



    I passed this way a year ago

    The wind blew south  the noon of day
    Was warm as Junes  and save that snow
    Flecked the low mountains far away
    And that the vernalseeming breeze
    Mocked faded grass and leafless trees
    I might have dreamed of summer as I lay
    Watching the fallen leaves with the soft
    wind at play



    Since then the winter blasts have piled

    The white pagodas of the snow
    On these rough slopes aud strong and
    wild
    Yon river in its overflow
    Of springtime rain and sun set free
    Crashed with its ices to the sea
    And over these gray fields then green aud

    gold
    The summer corn has waved the thunders
    organ rolled



    Rich gift of God  A year of time

    What pomp of rise and shut of day
    What hues wherewith our Northern clime

    Makes autumns dropping woodlands

    giy

    What airs outblown from ferny dells
    And cloverbloom and sweetbrier smells
    What songs of brooks and birds what fruits

    and flowers
    Green woods and moonlit snows have in
    its round been ours



    I know not how in other lands

    The changing seasons come aud go

    What spendors fall on Syrian sands
    What purple lights on Alpine snow



    THE LAST WALK IN AUTUMN



    151



    Nor how the poinp of sunrise waits
    On Venice at her watery gates
    A dream alone to me is Aruos vale
    And the Alhambras halls are but a travel
    lers tale



    Yet on lifes current he who drifts

    Is one with him who rows or sails
    And he who wanders widest lifts

    No more of beautys jealous veils
    Than he who from his doorway sees
    The miracle of flowers and trees
    Feels the warm Orient in the noonday air
    And from cloud minarets hears the sunset
    call to prayer



    The eye may well be glad that looks
    Where Pharpars fountains rise and
    fall
    But he who sees his native brooks

    Laugh in the sun has seen them all
    The marble palaces of Ind
    Rise round him in the snow and wind
    From his lone sweetbrier Persian Hafiz

    smiles
    And Romes cathedral awe is in his wood
    land aisles



    And thus it Is my fancy blends

    The near at hand and far and rare
    And while the same horizon bends
    Above the silversprinkled hair
    Which flashed the light of morning skies
    On childhoods wonderlifted eyes
    Within its round of sea and sky and field
    Earth wheels with all her zones the Kosmos
    stands revealed

    XI

    And thus the sick man on his bed

    The toiler to his taskwork bound
    Behold their prisonwalls outspread

    Their clipped horizon widen round
    While freedomgiving fancy waits
    Like Peters angel at the gates
    The power is theirs to baffle care and pain
    To bring the lost world back and make it
    theirs again



    What lack of goodly company
    When masters of the ancient lyre



    Obey my call and trace for me

    Their words of mingled tears and fire
    I talk with Bacon grave and wise
    I read the world with Pascals eyes
    And priest and sage with solemn brows

    austere
    And poets garlandbound the Lords of
    Thought draw near



    Methinks O friend I hear thee say

    In vain the human heart we mock
    Bring living guests who love the day
    Not ghosts who fly at crow of cock
    The herbs we share with flesh and blood
    Are better than ambrosial food
    With laurelled shades I grant it nothing

    loath
    But doubly blest is he who can partake of
    both



    He who might Platos banquet grace

    Have I not seen before me sit
    And watched his puritanic face

    With more than Eastern wisdom lit
    Shrewd mystic  who upon the back
    Of his Poor Richards Almanac
    Writing the Sufis song the Gentoos dream
    Links Manns age of thought to Fultons
    age of steam



    Here too of answering love secure

    Have I not welcomed to my hearth
    The gentle pilgrim troubadour

    Whose songs have girdled half the
    earth
    Whose pages like the magic mat
    Whereon the Eastern lover sat
    Have borne me over Rhinelands purple

    vines
    And Nubias tawny sands and Phrygias
    mountain pines

    XVI

    And he who to the lettered wealth

    Of ages adds the lore unpriced
    The wisdom and the moral health

    The ethics of the school of Christ
    The statesman to his holy trust
    As the Athenian archon just
    Struck down exiled like him for truth alone
    Has he not graced my home with beauty
    all his own

    POEMS OF NATURE



    What greetings smile what farewells
    wave
    What loved ones enter and depart
    The good the beautiful the brave
    The Heavenlent treasures of the
    heart
    How conscious seems the frozen sod
    And beechen slope whereon they trod
    The oakleaves rustle and the dry grass

    bends
    Beneath the shadowy feet of lost or absent
    friends

    XVIII

    Then ask not why to these bleak hills

    I cling as clings the tufted moss
    To bear the winters lingering chills

    The mocking springs perpetual loss
    I dream of lands where summer smiles
    And soft winds blow from spicy isles
    But scarce would Ceylons breath of flow
    ers be sweet
    Could I not feel thy soil New England at
    my feet

    XIX

    At times I long for gentler skies

    And bathe in dreams of softer air
    But homesick tears would fill the eyes

    That saw the Cross without the Bear
    The pine must whisper to the palm
    The northwind break the tropic calm
    And with the dreamy languor of the Line
    The Norths keen virtue blend and strength
    to beauty join



    Better to stem with heart and hand
    The roaring tide of life than lie
    Unmindful on its flowery strand
    Of Gods occasions drifting by
    Better with naked nerve to bear
    The needles of this goading air
    Than in the lap of sensual ease forego
    The godlike power to do the godlike aim
    to know

    XXI

    Home of my heart  to me niore fair
    Than gay Versailles or Windsors halls

    The painted shingly townhouse where
    The freemans vote for Freedom falls



    The simple roof where prayer is made
    Than Gothic groin and colonnade
    The living temple of the heart of man
    Than Romes skymocking vault or many
    spired Milan



    More dear thy equal village schools

    Where rich and poor the Bible read
    Than classic halls where Priestcraft rules
    And Learning wears the chains of
    Creed
    Thy glad Thanksgiving gathering in
    The scattered sheaves of home and kin
    Than the mad license ushering Lenten

    pains
    Or holidays of slaves who laugh and dance
    in chains



    And sweet homes nestle in these dales

    And perch along these wooded swells
    And blest beyond Arcadian vales

    They hear the sound of Sabbath bells
    Here dwells no perfect man sublime
    Nor woman winged before her time
    But with the faults and follies of the race
    Old homebred virtues hold their not un
    honored place

    XXIV

    Here manhood struggles for the sake

    Of mother sister daughter wife
    The graces and the loves which make

    The music of the march of life
    And woman in her daily round
    Of duty walks on holy ground
    No unpaid menial tills the soil nor here
    Is the bad lesson learned at human rights
    to sneer

    XXV

    Then let the icy northwind blow

    The trumpets of the coming storm
    To arrowy sleet and blinding snow

    Yon slanting lines of rain transform
    Young hearts shall hail the drifted cold
    As gayly as I did of old
    And I who watch them through the frosty

    pane
    Unenvious live in them my boyhood oer
    again



    THE OLD BURYINGGROUND



    153



    And I will trust that He who heeds

    The life that hides in mead and wold
    Who hangs yon alders crimson beads

    And stains these mosses green and gold
    Will stUl as He hath done incline
    His gracious care to me and mine
    Grant what we ask aright from wrong debar
    And as the earth grows dark make brighter
    every star

    XXVII

    I have not seen I may not see

    My hopes for man take form in fact
    But God will give the victory

    In due time  in that faith I act
    And he who sees the future sure
    The baffling present may endure
    And bless meanwhile the unseen Hand

    that leads
    The hearts desires beyond the halting step
    of deeds



    And thou my song I send thee forth
    Where harsher songs of mine have
    flown
    Go find a place at home and hearth

    WTiereer thy singers name is known
    Revive for him the kindly thought
    Of friends  and they who love him
    not
    Touched by some strain of thme perchance

    may take
    The hand he proffers all and thank him for
    thy sake



    THE FIRST FLOWERS

    For ages on our river borders

    These tassels in their tawny bloom

    And willowy studs of downy silver
    Have prophesied of Spring to come

    For ages have the unbound waters

    Smiled on them from their pebbly hem

    And the clear carol of the robin

    And song of bluebird welcomed tjiem

    But never yet from smUing river
    Or song of early bird have they

    Been greeted with a gladder welcome
    Than whispers from my heart today



    They break the spell of cold and darkness
    The weary watch of sleepless pain

    And from my heart as from the river
    The ice of winter melts again

    Thanks Mary  for this wildwood token
    Of Freyas footsteps drawing near

    Almost as in the rune of Asgard
    The growing of the grass I hear

    It is as if the pinetrees called me
    From ceiled room and silent books

    To see the dance of woodland shadows
    And hear the song of April brooks

    As in the old Teutonic ballad
    Of Odenwald live bird and tree

    Together live in bloom and music
    I blend in song thy flowers and thee

    Earths rocky tablets bear forever

    The dint of rain and small birds track

    Who knows but that my idle verses
    May leave some trace by Merrimac

    The bird that trod the mellow layers
    Of the yoimg earth is sought in vain

    The cloud is gone that wove the sandstone
    From Gods design with threads of rain

    So when this fluid age we live in

    Shall stiffen round my careless rhyme

    Wlio made the vagrant tracks may puzzle
    The savants of the coming time

    And following out their dim suggestions
    Some idlycurious hand may draw

    My doubtful portraiture as Cuvier
    Drew fish and bird from fin and claw

    And maidens in the faroff twilights

    Singing my words to breeze and stream

    Shall wonder if the oldtime Mary
    Were real or the rhymers dream



    THE OLD BURYINGGROUND

    Our vales are sweet with fern and rose
    Our hills are maplecrowned

    But not from them our fathers chose
    The village buryingground

    The dreariest spot in all the laud
    To Death they set apart

    POEMS OF NATURE



    With scanty grace from Natuies band
    And none from that of art

    A winding wall of mossy stone

    Frostflung and broken lines
    A lonesome acre thinly grown

    With grass and wandering vines

    Withont the wall a birehtree shows
    Its drooped and tasselled head

    Within a staghorn sumach grows
    Fernleafed with spikes of red

    There sheep that graze the neighboring
    plain

    Like white ghosts come and go
    Tlie farmhorse drags his fetlock chain

    The cowbell tinkles slow

    Low moans the river from its bed

    The distant pines reply
    Like mourners shrinking from the dead

    They stand apart and sigh

    Unshaded smites the summer sim

    Unchecked the winter blast
    The schoolgirl learns the place to shun

    With glances backward cast

    For thus our fathers testified

    That he might read who ran
    The emptiness of human pride

    The nothingness of man

    They dared not plant the grave with flow
    ers

    Nor dress the funeral sod
    Where with a love as deep as ours

    They left their dead with God

    The hard and thorny path they kept

    From beauty turned aside
    Nor missed they over those who slept

    The grace to life denied

    Yet still the wilding flowers would blow
    The golden leaves would fall

    The seasons come the seasons go
    And God be good to all

    Above the graves the blackberry hung
    In bloom and green its wreath



    And harebells swung as if they rung
    The chimes of peace beneath

    The beauty Nature loves to share

    The gifts she hath for all
    The common light the common air

    Oercrept the graveyards wall

    It knew the glow of eventide

    The sunrise and the noon
    And glorified and sanctified

    It slept beneath the moon

    With flowers or snowflakes for its sod

    Around the seasons ran
    And evermore the love of God

    Rebuked the fear of man

    We dwell with fears on either hand

    Within a daily strife
    And spectral problems waiting stand

    Before the gates of life

    The doubts we vainly seek to solve
    The truths we know are one

    The known and nameless stars revolve
    Around the Central Sun

    And if we reap as we have sown

    And take the dole we deal
    The law of pain is love alone

    The wounding is to heal

    Unharmed from change to change we glide

    We fall as in our dreams
    The faroff terror at our side

    A smiling angel seems

    Secure on Gods alltender heart

    Alike rest great and small
    Why fear to lose our little part

    When He is pledged for all

    O fearful heart and troubled brain

    Take hope and strength from this
    That Nature never hints in vain

    Nor prophesies amiss

    Her wild birds sing the same sweet stave

    Her lights and airs are given
    Alike to playground and the grave

    And over both is Heaven



    THE RIVER PATH



    155



    THE PALMTREE

    Is it the palm the cocoapalm

    On the Indian Sea by the isles of balm

    Or is it a ship in the breezeless calm

    A ship whose keel is of palm beneath
    Whose ribs of palm have a palmbark

    sheath
    And a rudder of palm it steereth with

    Branches of palm are its spars and rails
    Fibres of palm are its woven sails
    And the rope is of palm that idly trails

    What does the good sliip bear so well
    The cocoanut with its stony shell
    And the milky sap of its inner cell

    What are its jars so smooth and fine
    But hollowed nuts filled with oil and

    wine
    And the cabbage that ripens under the

    Line

    AVho smokes his nargileh cool and calm
    The master whose cunning and skill could

    charm
    Cargo and ship from the bounteous palm

    In the cabin he sits on a palmmat soft
    From a beaker of palm his drink is quaffed
    And a palmthatch shields from the sun
    aloft

    His dress is woven of palmy strands
    And he holds a palm leaf scioU in his

    hands
    Traced with the Prophets wise commands

    The turban folded about his head

    Was daintily wrought of the palmleaf

    braid
    And the fan that cools him of palm was

    made

    Of threads of palm was the carpet spmi
    Whereon he kneels when the day is done
    And the foreheads of Islam are bowed as
    one

    To him the palm is a gift divine
    Wherein all uses of man combine
    House and raiment and food and wine



    And in the hour of his great release
    His need of the palm shall only cease
    With the shroud wherein he lieth in peace

    Allah il Allah   he sings his psalm
    On the Indian Sea by the isles of balm
    Thanks to Allah who gives the palm

    THE RIVER PATH

    No biidsong floated down the hill
    The tangled bank below was still

    No rustle from the birchen stem
    No ripple from the waters hem

    The dusk of twilight round us grew
    We felt the falling of the dew

    For from us ere the day was done
    The wooded hills shut out the sun

    But on the rivers farther side
    We saw the hilltops glorified

    A tender glow exceeding fair
    A dream of day without its glare

    With us the damp the chill the gloom
    With them the sunsets rosy bloom

    While dark through willowy vistas seen
    The river rolled in shade between

    From out the darkness where we trod
    We gazed upon those hills of God

    Whose light seemed not of moon or sun
    We spake not but our thought was one

    We paused as if from that bright shore
    Beckoned our dear ones gone before

    And stilled our beating hearts to hear
    The voices lost to mortal ear

    Sudden our pathway turned from night
    The hills swvmg open to the light

    Through their green gates the sunshine

    showed
    A long slant splendor downward flowed

    Down glade and glen and bank it rolled
    It bridged the shaded stream with gold

    POEMS OF NATURE



    And borne on piers of mist allied
    The shadowy with the sunlit side

    So prayed we when onr feet draw

    near
    The river dark with mortal fear

    And the night cometh chill with dew
    O Father  let Thy light break through

    So let the hills of doubt divide

    So bridge with faith the sunless tide

    So let the eyes that fail on earth
    On Thy eternal hills look forth

    And in Thy beckoning angels know
    The dear ones whom we loved below



    MOUNTAIN PICTURES

    I FRANCONIA FROM THE PEMIGEWASSET

    Okck more O Mountains of the North un
    veil
    Your brows and lay your cloudy mantles
    by
    And once more ere the eyes that seek ye
    fail
    Uplift against the blue walls of the sky
    Your mighty shapes and let the sunshine
    weave
    Its golden network in your belting woods
    Smile down in rainbows from your fall
    ing floods
    And on your kingly brows at morn and eve
    Set crowns of fire  So shall my soul
    receive
    Haply the secret of your calm and strength
    Your imforgotten beauty interfuse
    My common life your glorious shapes and

    hues
    And sundropped splendors at my bidding

    come
    Loom vast through dreams and stretch
    in billowy length
    From the sealevel of my lowland home

    They rise before me  Last nights thun
    dergust

    Roared not in vain  for where its light
    nings thrust

    Their tongues of fire the great peaks seem
    so near



    Burned clean of mist so starkly bold and

    clear
    I almost pause the wind in the pines to hear
    The loose rocks fall the steps of browsing

    deer
    The clouds that shattered on yon slideworn
    walls
    And splintered on the rocks their spears
    of rain
    Have set in play a thousand waterfalls
    Making the dusk and silence of the woods
    Glad with the laughter of the chasing floods
    And luminous with blown spray and silver

    gleams
    While in the vales below the drylipped
    streams
    Sing to the freshened meadowlands
    again
    So let me hope the battlestorm that beats
    The land with hail and nre may pass away
    With its spent thunders at the break of
    day
    Like last nights clouds and leave as it
    retreats
    A greener earth and fairer sky behind
    Blown crystalclear by Freedoms North

    II MONADNOCK FROM WACHUSET

    I would I were a painter for the sake
    Of a sweet picture and of her who led
    A fitting guide with reverential tread
    Into that mountain mystery First a lake
    Tinted with sunset  next the wavy lines
    Of far receding hills  and yet more
    far
    Monadnock lifting from his night of pines
    His rosy forehead to the evening star
    Beside us purplezoned Waehuset laid
    His head against the West whose warm
    light made
    His aureole  and oer him sharp and
    clear
    Like a shaft of lightning in midlaunching
    stayed
    A single level cloudline shone upon
    By the fierce glances of the simken sun
    Menaced the darkness witli its golden
    spear

    So twilight deepened round us Still and

    black
    The great woods climbed the mountain at

    our back



    THE VANISHERS



    157



    And on their skirts where yet the lingering

    day
    On the shorn greenness of the clearing lay
    The brown old farmhouse like a birds
    uest hung
    With homelife sounds the desert air was

    stirred
    The bleat of sheep along the hill we

    heard
    The bucket plashing in the cool sweet

    well
    The pasture  bars that clattered as they

    fell
    Dogs barked fowls fluttered cattle lowed

    the gate
    Of the barnjard creaked beneath the mer
    ry weight
    Of sunbrown children listening while
    they swung
    The welcome sound of suppercall to

    hear
    And down the shadowy lane in tink
    lings clear
    The pastoral curfew of the cowbell rung
    Thus soothed and pleased our backward
    path we took
    Praising the farmers home He only

    spake
    Looking into the sunset oer the lake
    Like one to whom the faroff is most
    near
    Yes most folks think it has a pleasant
    look
    I love it for my good old mothers sake
    Who lived and died here in the peace
    of God
    The lesson of his words we pondered
    oer
    As silently we turned the eastern flank
    Of the mountain where its shadow deepest

    sank
    Doubling the night along our rugged road
    We felt that man was more than his
    abode
    The inward life than Natures raimeut
    more
    And the warm sky the sundowntinted hill
    The forest and the lake seemed dwarfed
    and dim
    Before the saintly soul whose human will
    Meekly in the Paternal footsteps trod
    Making her homely toil and household ways
    An earthly echo of the song of praise
    Swelling from angel lips and harps of
    seraphim



    THE VANISHERS

    Sweetest of all childlike dreams

    In the simple Indian lore
    Still to me the legend seems

    Of the shapes who flit before

    Flitting passing seen and gone
    Never reached nor found at rest

    Baffling search but beckoning ou
    To the Sunset of the Blest

    From the clefts of momitain rocks
    Through the dark of lowland firs

    Flash the eyes and flow the locks
    Of the mystic Vanishers

    And the fisher in his skiff
    And the hunter on the moss

    Hear their call from cape and cliff
    See their hands the birchleaves toss

    Wistful longing through the green
    Twilight of the clustered pines

    In their faces rarely seen

    Beauty more than mortal shines

    Fringed with gold their mantles flow
    On the slopes of westering knolls

    In the wind they whisper low
    Of the Sunset Land of Souls

    Doubt who may O friend of mine

    Thou and I have seen them too
    On before with beck and sign

    Still they glide and we pursue

    More than clouds of purple trail

    In the gold of setting day
    More than gleams of wing or sail

    Beckon from the seamist gray

    Glimpses of immortal youth

    Gleams and glories seen and flown

    Farheard voices sweet with truth
    Airs from viewless Eden blown

    Beauty that eludes our grasp

    Sweetness that transcends our taste

    Loving hands we may not clasp
    Shining feet that mock our haste

    Gentle eyes we closed below
    Tender voices heard once more

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Smile and call iis as they go
    On and onward still before

    Guided thus O friend of mine

    Let us walk our little way
    Knowing by each beckoning sign

    That we are not quite astray

    Chase we still with baffled feet
    Smiling eye and waving hand

    Sought and seeker soon shall meet
    Lost and found in Sunset Land



    THE PAGEANT

    A SOUND as if from bells of silver
    Or elfin cymbals smitten clear
    Through the frostpictured panes I
    hear

    A brightness which outshines the morning
    A splendor brooking no delay
    Beckons and tempts my feet away

    I leave the trodden village highway

    For virgin snow paths glimmering

    through
    A jewelled elmtree avenue

    Where keen against the walls of sap
    phire
    The gleaming treebolls iceembossed
    Hold up their chandeliers of frost

    I tread in Orient halls enchanted

    I dream the Sagas dream of caves
    Gemlit beneath the North Sea waves

    I walk the land of Eldorado

    I touch its mimic garden bowers

    Its silver leaves and diamond flowers

    The flora of the mystic mineworld
    Around me lifts on crystal stems
    The petals of its clustered gems

    What miracle of weird transforming

    In this wild work of frost and light
    This glimpse of glory infinite

    This foregleam of the Holy City

    Like that to him of Patmos given
    The white bride coming down from
    heaven



    How flash the ranked and mailclad alders
    Through what sharpglancing spears of

    reeds
    The brook its muffled water leads

    Yon maple like the bush of Horeb

    Burns unconsumed  a white cold fire
    Rays out from every grassy spire

    Each slender rush and spike of mullein
    Low laurel shrub and drooping fern
    Tiansfigured blaze whereer I turn

    How yonder Ethiopian hemlock

    Crowned with his glistenmg circlet

    stands
    What jewels light his swarthy hands

    Here where the forest opens southward
    Between its hospitable pines
    As through a door the warm sun shines

    The jewels loosen on the branches

    And lightly as the soft winds blow
    Fall tinkling on the ice below

    And through the clashing of their cymbals
    I hear the old familiar fall
    Of water down the rocky wall

    Wliere from its wintry prison breaking
    In dark and silence hidden long
    The brook repeats its summer song

    One instant flashing in the sunshine
    Keen as a sabre from its sheath
    Then lost again the ice beneath

    I hear the rabbit lightly leaping

    The foolish screaming of the jay
    The choppers axestroke far away

    The clamor of some neighboring barn
    yard
    The lazy cocks belated crow
    Or cattletramp in crispy snow

    And as in some enchanted forest

    The lost knight hears his comrades

    sing
    And near at hand their bridles ring

    So welcome I these somids and voices

    These airs from faroff summer blown
    This life that leaves me not alone



    A MYSTERY



    159



    For the white glory overawes me
    The crystal terror of the seer
    Of Chebars vision blinds me here

    Rebuke me not O sappliire heaven
    Thou stainless earth lay not on me
    Thy keen reproach of piuity

    If in this august presencechamber

    I sigh for summers leafgreen gloom
    And warm airs thick with odorous
    bloom

    Let the strange frostwork sink and crumble
    And let the loosened treeboughs swing
    Till all their bells of silver ring

    Shine warmly doyn thou sun of noontime
    On this chill pageant melt and move
    The winters frozen heart with love

    And soft and low thou wind southblowing
    Breathe through a veil of tenderest

    haze
    Thy prophecy of summer days

    Come with thy green relief of promise
    And to this dead cold splendor bring
    The living jewels of the spring



    THE PRESSED GENTIAN

    The time of gifts has come again
    And on my northern windoAVpane
    Outlined against the days brief light
    A Christmas token hangs in sight
    The wayside travellers as they pass
    Mark the gray disk of clouded glass
    And the dull blankness seems perchance
    Folly to their wise ignorance

    They cannot from their outlook see
    The perfect grace it hath for me
    For there the flower whose fringes through
    The frosty breath of autunin blew
    Turns from without its face of bloom
    To the warm tropic of my room
    As fair as when beside its brook
    The hue of bending skies it took

    So from the trodden ways of earth
    Seem some sweet souls who veil their worth
    And oflfer to the careless glance
    The clouding gray of circumstance



    They blossom best where hearthfires burn
    To loving eyes alone they turn
    The flowers of inward grace that hide
    Their beauty from the world outside

    But deeper meanings come to me
    My halfimmortal flower from thee
    Man judges from a partial view
    None ever yet his brother knew
    The Eternal Eye that sees the whole
    May better read the darkened soul
    And find to outward sense denied
    The flower upon its inmost side

    A MYSTERY

    The river hemmed with leaning trees
    Wound through its meadows green

    A low blue line of mountains showed
    The open pines between

    One sharp tall peak above them all

    Clear into simlight sprang
    I saw the river of my dreams

    The mountains that I sang

    No chie of memory led me on

    But well the ways I knew
    A feeling of familiar things

    With every footstep grew

    Not otherwise above its crag

    Could lean the blasted pine
    Not otherwise the maple hold

    Aloft its red ensign

    So up the long and shorn foothills
    The mountain road shoidd creep

    So green and low the meadow fold
    Its redhaired kine asleep

    The river woimd as it should wind

    Their place the mountains took
    The white torn fringes of their clouds

    Wore no unwonted look

    Yet neer before that rivers rim

    Was pressed by feet of mine
    Never before mine eyes had crossed

    That broken mountain line

    A presence strange at once and known
    Valked with me as my guide

    The skirts of some forgotten life
    Trailed noiseless at my side

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Was it a dimremenibered dream

    Or glimpse tlirough jeons old
    The secret which the mountains kept

    The river never told

    But from the vision ere it passed

    A tender hope I drew
    And pleasant as a dawn of spring

    The thought within me grew

    That love would temper every change

    And soften all surprise
    And misty with the dreams of earth

    The hills of Heaven arise

    A SEA DREAM

    We saw the slow tides go and come
    The curving surflines lightly drawn

    The gray rocks touched with tender bloom
    Beneath the freshblown rose of dawn

    We saw in richer sunsets lost

    The sombre pomp of showery noons

    And signalled spectral sails that crossed
    The weird low light of rising moons

    On stormy eves from cliflP and head

    We saw the white spray tossed and
    spurned

    While over all in gold and red

    Its face of fire the lighthouse turned

    The railcar brought its daily crowds

    Half curious half indifferent
    Like passing sails or floating clouds

    We saw them as they came and went

    But one calm morning as we lay
    And watched the miragelifted wall

    Of coast across the dreamy bay
    And heard afar the curlew call

    And nearer voices wild or tame
    Of airy flock and childish throng

    Up from the waters edge there came
    Faint snatches of familiar song

    Careless we heard the singers choice
    Of old and common airs  at last

    The tender pathos of his voice
    In one low chanson held us fast

    A song that mingled joy and pain
    And memories old and sadly sweet



    While timing to its minor strain
    The waves in lapsing cadence beat



    The waves are glad in breeze and sun

    The rocks are fringed with foam
    I walk once more a haunted shore

    A stranger yet at home

    A land of dreams I roam

    Is this the wind the soft seavrind
    That stirred thy locks of brown

    Are these the rocks whose mosses knew
    The trail of thy light gown
    Where boy and girl sat down

    I see the gray forts broken wall
    The boats that rock below

    And out at sea the passing sails
    We saw so long ago
    Rosered in mornings glow

    The freshness of the early time

    On every breeze is blown
    As glad the sea as blue the sky

    The change is ours alone

    The saddest is my own

    A stranger now a worldworn man

    Is he who bears my name
    But thou methinks whose mortal life

    Immortal youth became

    Art evermore the same

    Thou art not here thou art not there
    Thy place I cannot see

    I only know that where thou art
    The blessed angels be
    And heaven is glad for thee

    Forgive me if the evil years
    Have left on me their sign

    Wash out O soul so beautiful
    The many stains of mine
    In tears of love divine

    I could not look on thee and live

    If thou weit by my side
    The vision of a shining one

    The white and heavenly bride

    Is well to me denied

    But turn to me thy dear girlface
    Without the angels crown



    SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP



    The wedded roses of thy lips
    Thy loose hair rippling down
    In waves of golden brown

    Look forth once more through space and
    time

    And let thy sweet shade fall
    In teuderest grace of soul and form

    On memorys frescoed wall

    A shadow and yet all

    Draw near more near forever dear

    Whereer I rest Or roam
    Or in the citys crowded streets

    Or by the blown sea foam

    The thought of thee is home



    At breakfast hour the singer read
    The city news with comment wise

    Like one who felt the pulse of trade
    Beneath his finger fall and rise

    His look his air his curt speech told
    The man of action not of books

    To whom the corners made in gold

    And stocks were more than seaside nooks

    Of life beneath the life confessed
    His song had hinted unawares

    Of flowers in traffics ledgeis pressed
    Of human hearts in bulls and bears

    But eyes in vain were turned to watch
    That face so hard and shrewd and strong

    And ears in vain grew sharp to catch
    The meaning of that morning song

    In vain some sweetvoiced querist sought
    To sound him leaving as she came

    Her baited album only caught
    A common unromantic name

    No word betrayed the mystery fine
    That trembled on the singers tongue

    He came and went and left no sign
    Behind him save the song he sung



    HAZEL BLOSSOMS

    The summer warmth has left the sky
    The summer songs have died away

    And withered in the footpaths lie
    The fallen leaves but yesterday
    With ruby and with tojiaz gay



    The grass is browning on the hills
    No pale belated flowers recall

    The astral frmges of the rills
    And drearily the dead vines fall
    Frostblackened from the roadside wall

    Yet through the gray and sombre wood
    Against the dusk of fir and pine

    Last of their floral sisterhood

    The hazels yellow blossoms shine
    The tawny gold of Africs mme

    Small beauty hath my unsung flower
    For spring to own or summer hail

    But in the seasons saddest hour

    To skies that weep and winds that wail
    Its glad surprisals never fail

    O days grown cold  O life grown old
    No rose of June may bloom again

    But like the hazels twisted gold
    Through early frost and latter rain
    Shall hints of summertime remain

    And as within the hazels bough
    A gift of mystic virtue dwells

    That points to golden ores below
    And in dry desert places tells
    Where flow unseen the cool sweet
    wells

    So in the wise Diviners hand
    Be mine the hazels grateful part

    To feel beneath a thirsty land
    The living waters thrill and start
    The beating of the rivulets heart

    Sufficeth me the gift to light

    With latest bloom the dark cold days

    To call some hidden siring to sight
    That in these dry and dusty ways
    Shall sing its pleasant song of praise

    O Love  the hazelwand may fail
    But thou canst lend tlie surer sjell

    That passing over Bacas vale
    Bepeats the oldtime miracle
    And makes the desertland a well



    SUNSET ON THE BEARCAMP

    A GOLD fringe on the purpling hem

    Of hills the river runs
    As down its long green valley falls

    POEMS OF NATURE



    The last of summers suns
    Along its tawny gravelbed

    Broadflowing swift and still
    As if its meadow levels felt

    The hurry of the hill
    Noiseless between its banks of green

    From curve to curve it slips
    The drowsy mapleshadows rest

    Like fingers on its lips

    A waif from Carrolls wildest hills

    Unstoried and unknown
    The ursine legend of its name

    Prowls on its banks alone
    Yet flowers as fair its slopes adorn

    As ever Yarrow knew
    Or under rainy Irish skies

    By Spensers Mulla grew
    And through the gaps of leaning trees

    Its mountain cradle shows
    The gold against the amethyst

    The green against the rose

    Touched by a light that hath no name

    A glory never sung
    Aloft on sky and mountain wall

    Are Gods great pictures hung
    How changed the smnmits vast and old

    No longer granitebrowed
    They melt in rosy mist  the rock

    Is softer than the cloud
    The valley holds its breath  no leaf

    Of all its elms is twirled
    The silence of eteiniity

    Seems falling on the world

    The pause before the breaking seals

    Of mystery is this
    Yon miracleplay of night and day

    Makes dumb its witnesses
    What unseen altar crowns the hills

    That reach up stair on stair
    What eyes look through what white wings
    fan

    These purple veils of air
    What Presence from the heavenly heights

    To those of earth stoops down
    Not vainly Hellas dreamed of gods

    On Idas snowy crown

    Slow fades the vision of the sky

    The golden water pales
    And over all the valleyland

    A graywinged vapor sails
    I go the common way of all



    The sunset fires will bixrn
    The flowers will blow the river flow

    When I no more return
    No whisper from the mountain pine

    Nor lapsing stream shall tell
    The stranger treading where I tread

    Of him who loved them well

    But beauty seen is never lost

    Gods colors all are fast
    The glory of this sunset heaven

    Into my soul has passed
    A sense of gladness unconfined

    To mortal date or clime
    As the soul liveth it shall live

    Beyond the years of time
    Beside the mystic asphodels

    Shall bloom the homeborn flowers
    And new horizons flush and glow

    With sunset hues of ours

    Farewell  these smiling hills must wear

    Too soon their wintry frown
    And snowcold winds from off them shake

    The maples red leaves down
    But I shall see a summer smi

    Still setting broad and low
    The mountain slopes shall blush and bloom

    The golden water flow
    A lovers claim is mine on all

    I see to have and hold
    The roselight of perpetual hiUs

    And sunsets never cold

    THE SEEKING OF THE WATER
    FALL

    They left their home of summer ease
    Beneath the lowlands sheltering trees
    To seek by ways unknown to all
    The promise of the waterfall

    Some vague faint rumor to the vale
    Had crept  perchance a hunters tale
    Of its wild mirtli of waters lost
    On the dark woods thiough which it tossed

    Somewhere it laughed and sang  some
    where
    Whirled in mad dance its misty hair
    But who had raised its veil or seen
    The rainbow skirts of that Undine

    They sought it where the mountain brook
    Its swift way to the valley took



    THE SEEKING OF THE WATERFALL



    163



    Along the rugged slope they clomb
    Their guide a thread of sound and foam

    Height after height they slowly won
    The fiery javelins of the sun
    Smote the bare ledge  the tangled shade
    With rock and vine their steps delayed

    But through leafopenings now and then
    They saw the cheerful homes of men
    And the great mountains with their wall
    Of misty purple girdling all

    The leaves through which the glad winds

    blew
    Shared the wild dance the waters knew
    And where the shadows deepest fell
    The woodthrush rang his silver bell

    Fringing the stream at every turn
    Swung low the waving fronds of fern
    From stony cleft and mossy sod
    Pale asters sprang and goldenrod

    And still the water sang the sweet
    Glad song that stirred its gliding feet
    And found in rock and root the keys
    Of its beguiling melodies

    Beyond above its signals flew
    Of tossing foam the birchtrees through
    Now seen now lost but baffling still
    The weary seekers slackening will

    Each called to each   Lo here  Lo

    there
    Its white scarf flutters in the air
    They climbed anew  the vision fled
    To beckon higher overhead

    So toiled they up the mountainslope
    With faint and ever fainter hope
    With faint and fainter voice the brook
    Still bade them listen pause and look

    Meanwhile below the day was done
    Above the tall peaks saw the sun
    Sink beamshorn to its misty set
    Behind the hills of violet

    Here ends our quest    the seekers

    cried
    The brook and rumor both have lied
    The phantom of a waterfall
    Has led us at its beck and call



    But one with years grown wiser said
    So always baffled not misled
    We follow where before us runs
    The vision of the shining ones

    Not where they seem their signals fly
    Their voices while we listen die
    We cannot keep however fleet
    The quick time of their winged feet

    From youth to age unresting stray
    These kindly mockers in our way
    Yet lead they not the baffling elves
    To something better than themselves

    Here though unreached the goal we

    sought
    Its own reward our toil has brought
    The winding waters sounding rush
    The long note of the hermit thrush

    The turquoise lakes the glimpse of pond
    And river track and vast beyond
    Broad meadows belted round with pines
    The grand uplift of mountain lines

    What matter though we seek with pain
    The garden of the gods in vain
    If lured thereby we climb to greet
    Some wayside blossom Edensweet

    To seek is better than to gain
    The fond hope dies as we attain
    Lifes fairest things are those which seem
    The best is that of which we dream

    Then let us trust our waterfall
    Still flashes down its rocky wall
    With rainbow crescent curved across
    Its sunlit spray from moss to moss

    And we forgetfid of our pain
    In thought shall seek it oft again
    Shall see this asterblossomed sod
    This sunshine of the goldenrod

    And haply gain through parting boughs
    Grand glimpses of great mountain brows
    Cloudturbaned and the sharp steel sheen
    Of lakes deep set in valleys green

    So failure wins  the consequence
    Of loss becomes its recompense
    And evermore tlie end shall tell
    The unreached ideal Quided well

    POEMS OF NATURE



    Our sweet illusions only die
    Fulfilling loves sure prophecy
    And every wish for better things
    An undreamed beauty nearer brings

    For fate is servitor of love
    Desire and hope and longing prove
    The secret of immortal youth
    And Nature cheats us into truth

    O kind allurers wisely sent
    Beguiling with benign intent
    Still move us through divine unrest
    To seek the loveliest and the best I

    Go with us when our souls go free
    And in the clear white light to be
    Add unto Heavens beatitude
    The old delight of seeking good



    THE TRAILING ARBUTUS

    I WANDERED lonely where the pinetrees

    made
    Against the bitter East their barricade

    And guided by its sweet
    Perfume I found within a narrow dell
    The trailing spring flower tinted like a
    shell
    Amid dry leaves and mosses at my
    feet

    From under dead boughs for whose loss

    the pines
    Moaned ceaseless overhead the blossoming
    vines
    Lifted their glad surprise
    While yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless

    trees
    His feathers ruffled by the chill seabreeze
    And snowdrifts lingered under April
    skies

    As pausing oer the lonely flower I bent
    I thought of lives thus lowly clogged and
    pent
    Which yet find room
    Through care and cumber coldness and

    decaj
    To lend a sweetness to the ungenial day
    And make the sad earth happier for their
    bloom



    ST MARTINS SUMMER

    This name in some parts of Euroise is given
    to the season we call Indian Summer in honor
    of the good St Martui The title of the poem
    was suggested by the fact that the day it refers
    to was the exact date of that set apart to the
    Saint the 11th of November

    Though flowers have perished at the touch

    Of Frost the early comer
    I hail the season loved so much

    The good St Martins summer

    O gracious morn with rosered dawn
    And thin moon curving oer it

    The old years darling latest born
    More loved than all before it

    How flamed the sunrise through the pines

    How stretched the birchen shadows
    Braiding in long windwavered lines

    The westward sloping meadows

    The sweet day opening as a flower

    Unfolds its petals tender
    Renews for us at noontides hour

    The summers tempered splendor

    The birds are hushed  alone the wind
    That through the woodland searches

    The redoaks lingering leaves can find
    And yellow illumes of larches

    But still the balsambreathing pine

    Invites no thought of sorrow
    No hint of loss from air like wine

    The earths content can borrow

    The summer and the winter here

    Midway a truce are holding
    A soft consenting atmosphere

    Their tents of peace enfolding

    The silent woods the lonely hills
    Rise solemn in their gladness

    The quiet that the valley fills
    Is scarcely joy or sadness

    How strange  The autumn yesterday
    In winters grasp seemed dying

    On whirling winds from skies of graj
    The early snow was flying



    A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE



    165



    And now while over Natures mood
    There steals a soft relenting

    I will not mar the present good
    Forecasting or lamenting

    My autumn time and Natures hold

    A dreamy tryst together
    And both grown old about us fold

    The goldentissued weather

    I lean my heart against the day
    To feel its bland caressing

    I will not let it pass away
    Before it leaves its blessing

    Gods angels come not as of old
    The Syrian shepherds knew them

    In reddening dawns in sunset gold
    And warm noon lights I view them

    Nor need there is in times like this
    When lieaven to earth draws nearer

    Of wing or song as witnesses
    To make their presence clearer

    O stream of life whose swifter flow

    Is of the end forewarning
    Methinks thy sundown afterglow

    Seems less of night than morning

    Old cares grow light  aside I lay
    The doubts and fears that troubled

    The quiet of the happy day
    Within my soul is doubled

    That clouds must veil this fair sunshine

    Not less a joy I find it
    Nor less yon warm horizon line

    That winter lurks behind it

    The mystery of the untried days
    I close my eyes from reading

    His will be done whose darkest ways
    To light and life are leading

    Less drear the winter night sliall be
    If memory cheer and hearten

    Its heavy hours with thoughts of thee
    Sweet summer of St Martin



    STORM ON LAKE ASQUAM

    A CLOUD like that the oldtime Hebrew saw
    On Carniel prophesying rain began



    To lift itself oer wooded Cardigan
    Growing and blackening Suddenly a flaw

    Of chfll wind menaced  then a strong blast
    beat
    Down the long valleys murmming pines

    and woke
    The noondream of the sleeping lake and
    broke
    Its smooth steel mirror at the mountains
    feet

    Thunderous and vast a fireveined darkness
    swept
    Over the rough pinebearded Asquam

    range
    A wraith of tempest wonderful and
    strange
    From peak to peak the cloudy giant stepped

    One moment as if challenging the storm
    Chocoruas tall defiant sentinel
    Looked from his watchtower  then the
    shadow fell

    And the wild raindrift blotted out his form

    And over all the still unhidden sun

    Weaving its light through slantblown

    veils of rain
    Smiled on the trouble as hope smiles on
    pain
    And when the tumult and the strife were
    done

    With one foot on the lake and one on land
    Framingwithin his crescents tinted streak
    A faroff picture of the Melvin peak

    Spent broken clouds the rainbows angel
    spanned



    A SUMMER PILGRIMAGE

    To kneel before some saintly shrine
    To breathe the health of airs divine
    Or bathe where sacied rivers flow
    The cowled and turbaned pilgrims go
    I too a palmer take as they
    With staff and scallopshell my way
    To feel from burdening cares and ills
    The strong uplifting of the hills

    The years are many since at first
    For dreamedof wonders all athirst
    I saw on Winnipesaukee fall

    POEMS OF NATURE



    The shadow of the mountain wall
    Ah  where are they who sailed with me
    The beautiful islandstudded sea
    And am I he whose keen surprise
    Flashed out from such imclouded eyes

    Still when the sun of summer burns
    My longing for the hills returns
    And northward leaving at my back
    The warm vale of the Merrimae
    I go to meet the winds of morn
    Blown down the hillgaps mountainborn
    Breathe scent of pines and satisfy
    The hunger of a lowland eye

    Again I see the day decline
    Along a ridged horizon line
    Toucliing the hilltops as a nun
    Her beaded rosaiy sinks the sun
    One lake lies golden which shall soon
    Be silver in the rising moon
    And one the crimson of the skies
    And mountain piuple multiplies

    With the untroubled quiet blends
    The distancesoftened voice of friends
    The girls light laugh no discord brings
    To the low song the pinetree sings
    And not unwelcome comes the hail
    Of boyhood from his nearing sail
    The human presence breaks no spell
    And sunset still is miracle

    Calm as the hour me thinks I feel

    A sense of worship oer me steal

    Not that of satyrcharming Pan

    No cult of Nature shaming man

    Not Beautys self but that which lives

    And shines through all the veils it weaves

    Soul of the mountain lake and wood

    Their witness to the Eternal Good

    And if by fond illusion here

    The earth to heaven seems drawing near

    And yon outlying range invites

    To other and serener heights

    Scarce hid behind its topmost swell

    The shining Mounts Delectable

    A dream may hint of truth no less

    Than the sharp light of wakefulness

    As through her veil of incense smoke
    Of old the spellrapt priestess spoke
    More than her heathen oracle
    May not this trance of smiset tell



    That Natures forms of loveliness
    Their heavenly aichetypes confess
    Fashioned like Israels ark alone
    From patterns in the Mount made known

    A holier beauty overbroods
    These fair and faint similitudes
    Yet not unblest is he who sees
    Shadows of Gods realities
    And knows beyond this masquerade
    Of shape and color light and shade
    And dawn and set and wax and wane
    Eternal verities remain

    O gems of sapphire granite set

    hills that charmed horizons fret

    1 know how fair your morns can break
    In rosy light on isle and lake

    How over wooded slopes can run
    The noonday play of cloud and sun
    And evening droop her oriflamme
    Of gold and red in still Asquam

    The summer moons may round again
    And careless feet these hills profane
    These sunsets waste on vacant eyes
    The lavish splendor of the skies
    Fashion and folly misplaced here
    Sigh for their natural atmosphere
    And travelled pride the outlook scorn
    Of lesser heights than Matterhorn

    But let me dream that hill and sky
    Of vmseen beauty prophesy
    And in these thited lakes behold
    The trailing of the raiment fold
    Of that which still eluding gaze
    Allures to upwardtending ways
    Whose footprints make wherever found
    Our common earth a holy ground

    SWEET FERN

    The subtle power in perfume found
    Nor priest nor sibyl vainly learned

    On Grecian shrine or Aztec mound
    No censer idly burned

    That power the oldtime worships knew
    The Corybantes frenzied dance

    The Pythian priestess swooning through
    The wonderland of trance

    And Nature holds in wood and field
    Her thousand sunlit censers still



    THE WOOD GIANT



    167



    To spells of flower and shnib we yield
    Against or with our will

    I climbed a hill path strange and new
    With slow feet pausing at each turn

    A sudden waft of west wind blew
    The breath of the sweet fern

    That fragrance from my vision swept
    The alien landscape  in its stead

    Up fairer hills of youth I stepped
    As light of heart as tread

    I saw my boyhoods lakelet shine

    Once more tkrough rifts of woodland
    shade

    I knew my rivers winding line
    By morning mist betrayed

    With me Junes freshness lapsing brook
    Murmurs of leaf and bee the call

    Of birds and one in voice and look
    In keeping with them all

    A fern beside the way we went

    She plucked and smiling held it up

    While from her hand the wild sweet
    scent
    I drank as from a cup

    O potent witchery of smell

    The dustdry leaves to life return
    And she who plucked them owns the spell

    And lifts her ghostly fern

    Or sense or spirit  Who shall say

    What touch the chord of memory thrills

    It passed and left the August day
    Ablaze on lonely hills



    THE WOOD GIANT

    Written at Sturtevants Farm about a mile
    from Centre Harbor N H

    From Alton Bay to Sandwich Dome

    From Mad to Saco river
    For patriarchs of the primal wood

    We sought with vain endeavor

    And then we said   The giants old

    Are lost beyond retrieval
    This pygmy growth the axe has spared

    Is not the wood primeval



    Look where we will oer vale and hill

    How idle are our searches
    For broad  girthed maples wide  limbed
    oaks

    Centennial pines and birches

    Their tortured limbs the axe and saw
    Have changed to beams and trestles

    They rest in walls they float on seas
    They rot in sunken vessels

    This shorn and wasted mountain land
    Of underbrvish and boulder

    Who thinks to see its fullgrown tree
    Must live a ceutury older

    At last to us a woodland path

    To open sunset leading
    Revealed the Anakim of pines

    Our wildest wish exceeding

    Alone the level sun before

    Below the lakes green islands
    Beyond in misty distance dim

    The rugged Northern Highlands

    Dark Titan on his Sunset Hill

    Of time and change defiant
    How dwarfed the common woodland
    seemed

    Before the oldtime giant

    What marvel that in simpler days
    Of the worlds early childhood

    Men crowned with garlands gifts and
    praise
    Such monarchs of the wildwood

    That Tyrian maids with flower and song
    Danced through the hill groves spaces

    And hoarybearded Druids foimd
    In woods their holy places

    With somewhat of that Pagan awe
    With Christian reverence blending

    We saw our pinetrees mighty arms
    Above our heads extending

    We heard his needles mystic rune

    Now rising and now dying
    As erst Dodonas priestess heard

    The oak leaves prophesying

    Was it the halfunconscious moan
    Of one apart and mateless

    POEMS OF NATURE



    The weariness of unshared power
    The loneliuess of greatness

    O dawns and sunsets lend to him
    Your beauty and your wonder

    Blithe sparrow sing thy summer song
    His solemn shadow imder

    Play lightly on his slender keys

    O wind of summer waking
    For hills like these the sound of seas

    On faroff beaches breaking

    And let the eagle and the crow

    Find shelter in his branches
    When winds shake down his winter snow

    In silver avalanches

    The brave are braver for their cheer
    The strongest need assurance

    The sigh of longing makes not less
    The lesson of endurance



    A DAY

    Talk not of sad November when a day
    Of warm glad sunshine fills the sky of

    noon
    And a wind borrowed from some morn
    of June
    Stirs the brown grasses and the leafless
    spray

    On the unfrosted pool the pillared pines
    Lay their long shafts of shadow  the
    small rill



    Singing a pleasant song of summer still
    A line of silver down the hillslope shines

    Hushed the bird voices and the hum of
    bees
    In the thm grass the crickets pipe no

    more
    But still the squirrel hoards his winter
    store
    And drops his nutshells from the shag
    bark trees

    Softly the dark green hemlocks whisper
    high
    Above the spbes of yellowing larches

    show
    Where the woodpecker and homeloving
    crow
    And jay and nut  hatch winters threat
    defy

    O gracious beaiity ever new and old
    O sights and sounds of nature doubly

    dear
    When the low sunshine warns the closing
    year
    Of snowblown fields and waves of Arctic
    cold

    Close to my heart I fold each lovely
    thing
    The sweet day yields  and not disconso
    late
    With the calm patience of the woods I
    wait
    For leaf and blossom when God gives us
    Spring



    PERSONAL POEMS



    A LAMENT

    The parted spirit
    Knoweth it not our sorrow  Ausweretk not
    Its blessing to our tears

    The circle is broken one seat is forsaken
    One bud from the tree of our friendship is

    shaken
    One heart from among us no longer shall

    thrill
    With joy in our gladness or grief in otir

    ill

    Weep  lonely and lowly are slumbering

    now
    The light of her glances the pride of her

    brow
    Weep  sadly and long shall we listen in

    vain
    To hear the soft tones of her welcome again

    Give our tears to the dead  For human
    itys claim

    From its silence and darkness is ever the
    same

    The hope of that world whose existence is
    bliss

    May not stifle the tears of the mourners of
    this

    For oh  if one glance the freed spirit can
    throw

    On the scene of its troubled probation be
    low

    Than the pride of the marble the pomp of
    the dead

    To that glance will be dearer the tears which
    we shed

    Oh who can forget the mild light of her
    smile

    Over lips moved with music and feeling the
    while

    The eyes deep enchantment dark dream
    like and clear

    In the glow of its gladness the shade of its
    tear



    And the charm of her features while over
    the whole

    Played the hues of tlie heart and the sun
    shine of soul

    And the tones of her voice like the music
    which seems

    Murniiired low in our ears by the Angel of
    dreams

    But holier and dearer our memories hold
    Those treasures of feeling more precious

    than gold
    The love and the kindness aud pity which

    gave
    Fresh flowers for the bridal green wreaths

    for the grave

    The heart ever open to Charitys claim
    Unmoved from its purpose by censure and

    blame
    While vainly alike on her eye and her ear
    Fell the scorn of the heartless the jesting

    and jeer

    How true to our hearts was that beautiful

    sleeper
    With smiles for the joyful with tears for

    the weeper
    Yet evermore prompt whether mournful

    or gay
    With warnings in love to the passing astray

    For though spotless herself she could sor
    row for them

    Who sullied with evil the spirits pure gem

    And a sigh or a tear could the erring reprove

    And the sting of reproof was still tempered
    by love

    As a cloud of the sunset slow melting in

    heaven
    As a star that is lost when the daylight is

    given
    As a glad dream of slumber which wakens

    in bliss
    She hath passed to the world of the holy

    from this

    The murmur of a Universe


    And the longsuspended thunder

    Joy to thy spirit brother

    Beyond the despots will

    Are of that soul a part


    Be all remembered then

    Or the cruel martyrdom


    Deny thy memory room


    We will think of thee brother


    For lying lips shall torture


    And thy sainted name shall be


    Thy mercy into crime


    In the blessing of the captive


    And the slanderer shall flourish

    PERSONAL POEMS



    All the mystery of Being

    Hath upon thy spirit pressed

    Thovights which like the Deluge wanderer
    Find no place of rest

    That which mystic Plato pondered
    That which Zeno heard with awe

    And the starrapt Zoroaster
    In his night watch saw

    From the doubt and darkness springing

    Of the dim uncertain Past
    Moving to the dark still shadows

    Oer the Future cast

    Early hath Lifes mighty question
    Thrilled within thy heart of youth

    With a deep and strong beseeching
    What and where is Truth

    Hollow creed and ceremonial

    Whence the ancient life hath fled

    Idle faith unknown to action
    Dull and cold and dead

    Oracles whose wireworked meanings

    Only wake a quiet scorn
    Not from these thy seeking spirit

    Hath its answer drawn

    But like some tired child at even
    On thy mother Natures breast

    Thou methinks art vainly seeking
    Truth and peace and rest

    Oer that mothers rugged features
    Thou art throwing Fancys veil

    Light and soft as woven moonbeams
    Beautiful and frail

    Oer the rough chart of Existence
    Rocks of sin and wastes of woe

    Soft airs breathe and green leaves tremble
    And cool fountains flow

    And to thee an answer cometh
    From the earth and from the sky

    And to thee the hills and waters
    And the stars reply

    But a soulsufficing answer

    Hath no outward origin
    More than Natures many voices

    May be heard within



    Even as the great Augustine

    Questioned earth and sea and sky

    And the dusty tomes of learning
    And old poesy

    But his earnest spirit needed

    More than outward Nature taught

    More than blest the poets vision
    Or the sages thought

    Only in the gathered silence
    Of a calm and waiting frame

    Light and wisdom as from Heaven
    To the seeker came

    Not to ease and aimless quiet
    Doth that inward answer tend

    But to works of love and duty
    As our beings end

    Not to idle dreams and trances
    Length of face and solemn tone

    But to Faith in daily striving
    And performance shown

    Earnest toil and strong endeavor

    Of a spirit which within
    Wrestles with familiar evil

    And besetting sin

    And without with tireless vigor
    Steady heart and weapon strong

    In the power of truth assailing
    Every form of wrong

    Guided thus how passing lovely
    Is the track of Woolmans feet

    And his brief and simple record
    How serenely sweet

    Oer lifes humblest duties throwing
    Light the earthling never knew

    Freshening all its dark waste places
    As with Hermons dew

    All which glows in Pascals pages
    All wliich sainted Guion sought

    Or the blueeyed German Rahel
    Halfunconscious taught

    Beauty such as Goethe pictured
    Such as Shelley dreamed of shed

    Living warmth and starry brightness
    Round that poor mans head



    TO A FRIEND



    173



    Not a vain and cold ideal

    Not a poets dieam alone
    But a presence warm and real

    Seen and felt and known

    When the red righthand of slaughter
    Moulders with the steel it swung

    When the name of seer and poet
    Dies on Memorys tongue

    All bright thoughts and pure shall gather
    Round that meek and suffering one

    Glorious like the seerseen angel
    Standing in the sun

    Take the good mans book and ponder

    What its pages say to thee
    Blessed as the hand of healing

    May its lesson be

    If it only serves to strengthen
    Yearnings for a higher good

    For the fount of living waters
    And diviner food

    If the pride of human reason
    Feels its meek and still rebuke

    Quailing like the eye of Peter
    From the Just Ones look

    If with readier ear thou heedest
    What the Inward Teacher saith

    Listening with a willing spirit
    And a childlike faith

    Thou mayst live to bless the giver
    Who himself but frail and weak

    Would at least the highest welfare
    Of another seek

    And his gift though poor and lowly

    It may seem to other eyes
    Yet may prove an angel holy

    In a pilgrims guise



    LEGGETTS MONUMENT

    William Leggett who died in 1839 at the
    age of thirtyseven was the intrepid editor of
    the Neiv York Evening Post and afterwards
    of The Plain Dealer His vigorous assault
    upon the system of slavery brought down upon
    him the enmity of political defenders of the
    system



    Ye build the tombs of the prophets  Holy Writ

    Yes pile the marble oer him  It is well
    That ye who mocked him in his long

    stern strife
    And planted in the pathway of his life
    The ploughshares of your hatred hot from
    hell
    Who clamored down the bold reformer

    when
    He pleaded for his captive fellowmen
    Who spurned him in the marketplace and
    sought
    Within thy walls St Tammany to bind
    In party chains the free and honest thought
    The angel utteiance of an upright mind
    Well is it now that oer his grave ye raise
    The stony tribute of your tardy praise
    For not alone that pile shall tell to Fame
    Of the brave heart beneath but of the
    builders shame

    ON HER RETURN FROM EUROPE

    How smiled the land of France
    Under thy blue eyes glance

    Lighthearted rover
    Old walls of chateaux gray
    Towers of an early day
    Which the Three Colors play

    Flauntingly over

    Now midst the brilliant train
    Thronging the banks of Seine

    Now midst the splendor
    Of the wild Alpine range
    Waking with change on change
    Thoughts in thy young heart strange

    Lovely and tender

    Vales soft Elysian
    Like those in the vision

    Of Mirza when dreaming
    He saw the long hollow dell
    Touched by the prophets spell
    Into an ocean swell

    With its isles teeming

    Cliffs wrapped in snows of years
    Splintering with icy spears

    Autumns blue heaven
    Loose rock and frozen slide
    Hung on the mountainside

    PERSONAL POEMS



    Waiting their hour to glide
    Downward stormdriven

    Rhinestream by castle old
    Barons and robbers hold

    Peacefully flowing
    Sweeping through vineyards green
    Or where the cliffs are seen
    Oer the broad wave between

    Grim shadows throwing

    Or where St Peters dome
    Swells oer eternal Rome

    Vast dim and solemn
    Hymns ever chanting low
    Censers swung to and fro
    Sable stoles sweeping slow

    Cornice and column

    Oh as from each and all
    Will there not voices call

    Evermore back again
    In the minds gallery
    Wilt thou not always see
    Dim phantoms beckon thee

    Oer that old track again

    New forms thy presence haunt
    New voices softly chant

    New faces greet thee
    Pilgrims from many a shrine
    Hallowed by poets line
    At memorys magic sign

    Rising to meet thee

    And when such visions come
    Unto thy olden home

    Will they not waken
    Deep thoughts of Him whose hand
    Led thee oer sea and land
    Back to the household band

    Whence thou wast taken

    While at the sunset time
    Swells the cathedrals chime

    Yet in thy dreaming
    While to thy spirits eye
    Yet the vast mountains lie
    Piled in the Switzers sky

    Icy and gleaming

    Prompter of silent prayer
    Be the wild picture there

    In the minds chamber
    And through each coming day



    Him who as staff and stay

    Watched oer thy wanderinc

    Freshly remember



    way



    So when the call shall be
    Soon or late unto thee

    As to all given
    Still may that picture live
    All its fair forms survive
    And to thy spirit give

    Gladness in Heaven



    LUCY HOOPER



    Lucy Hooper died at Brooklyn LI on the
    1st of 8th mo 1841 aged twentyfour years

    They tell me Lucy thou art dead

    That all of thee we loved and cherished
    Has with thy summer roses perished

    And left as its young beauty lied

    An ashen memory in its stead
    The twilight of a parted day

    Whose fading light is cold and vain
    The hearts faint echo of a strain

    Of low sweet music passed away
    That true and loving heart that gift

    Of a mind earnest clear profound
    Bestowing with a glad unthrift

    Its simny light on all around
    Affinities which only could
    Cleave to the pure the true and good

    And sympathies which found no rest

    Save with the loveliest and best
    Of them  of thee  remains there naught

    But sorrow in the mourners breast
    A shadow in the land of thought
    No  Even my weak and trembling faith

    Can lift for thee the veil which doubt

    And human fear have drawn about
    The allawaiting scene of death

    Even as thou wast I see thee still
    And save the absence of all ill
    And pain and weariness which here
    Summoned the sigh or wrung the tear
    The same as when two summers back
    Beside our childhoods Merrimac
    I saw thy dark eye wander oer
    Stream sunny upland rocky shore
    And heard thy low soft voice alone
    Midst lapse of waters and the tone
    Of pineleaves by the westwind blown
    There s not a charm of soul or brow
    Of all we knew and loved in thee

    But lives in holier beauty now

    Baptized in immortality
    Not mine the sad and freezing dream

    Of souls that with their earthly mould

    Cast off the loves and joys of old
    Unbodied like a pale moonbeam

    As pure as passionless and cold
    Nor mine the hope of Indras son

    Of slumbering in oblivions rest
    Lifes myriads blending into one

    In blank annihilation blest
    Dustatoms of the infinite
    Sparks scattered from the central light
    And winning back through mortal pain
    Their old miconsciousness again
    No  I have friends in Spirit Land
    Not shadows in a shadowy band

    Not others but themselves are they
    And still I think of them the same
    As when the Masters summons came
    Their change  the holy mornlight break
    ing
    Upon the dreamworn sleeper waking

    A change from twilight into day

    Theyve laid thee midst the household
    graves

    Where father brother sister lie
    Below thee sweep the dark blue waves

    Above thee bends the summer sky
    Thy own loved church in sadness read
    Her solemn ritual oer thy head
    And blessed and hallowed with her prayer
    The turf laid lightly oer thee there
    That church whose rites and liturgy
    Sublime and old were truth to thee
    Undoubted to thy bosom taken
    As symbols of a faith unshaken
    Even I of simpler views could feel
    The beauty of tliy trust and zeal
    And owning not thy creed could see
    How deep a truth it seemed to thee
    And how thy fervent heart had thrown
    Oer all a coloring of its own
    And kindled up intense and warm
    A life in every rite and form
    As when on Chebars banks of old
    The Hebrews gorgeous vision rolled
    A spirit filled the vast machine
    A life  within the wheels  was seen

    Farewell  A little time and we

    Who knew thee well and loved thee here

    One after one shall follow thee

    As pilgrims through the gate of fear



    Which opens on eternity

    Yet shall we cherisli not the less

    All that is left our hearts meanwhile
    The memory of thy loveliness

    Shall round our weary pathway smile
    Like moonlight when the sim has set
    A sweet and tender radiance yet
    Thoughts of thy cleareyed sense of duty

    Thy generovis scorn of all things wrong
    The truth the strength the graceful beauty

    Which blended in thy song
    All lovely things by thee beloved

    Shall whisper to our hearts of thee
    These green hills where thy childhood
    roved

    Yon river winding to the sea
    The sunset light of autumn eves

    Reflecting on the deep still floods
    Cloud crimson sky and trembling leaves

    Of rainbowtinted woods
    These in our view shall henceforth take
    A tenderer meaning for thy sake
    And all thou lovedst of earth and sky
    Seem sacred to thy memory

    ON READING HIS ESSAY ON THE FUTURE
    STATE

    Charles Follen one of the noblest contribu
    tions of Germany to American citizenship was
    at an early age driven from his piofessorship
    in the University of Jena and compelled to seek
    shelter from official prosecution in Switzerland
    on account of his liberal political opinions He
    became Professor of Civil Law in the Univer
    sity of Basle The governments of Prussia
    Austria and Russia united in demanding his
    delivery as a political offender  and in eonse
    qiience he left Switzerland and came to the
    United States At the time of the formation
    of the American AntiSlaveiy Society he was
    a Professor in Harvard University honored for
    his genius learning and estimable character
    His love of liberty and hatred of oppression led
    him to seek an interview with Garrison and ex
    press his sympathy with him Soon after he
    attended a meeting of the New England Anti
    Slavery Society An able speech was made by
    Rev A A Phelps and a letter of mine ad
    dressed to the Secretary of the Society was
    read Whereiipon he rose and stated that his
    views were in unison with those of the Society
    and that after hearing the speech and the let
    ter he was ready to join it and abide the
    probable consequences of such an unpopular
    act He lost by so doing his professorship

    He was an able member of the Executive
    Committee of tbe American AntiSlavery Soci
    ety He jjerished in the illfated steamer Lex
    ington which was burned on its passage from
    New York January 13 1840 The few writings
    left behind him show him to have been a
    profoimd thinker of rare spiritual insight

    Friend of my soul  as with moist eye
    I look up from this page of thine

    Is it a dream that thou art nigh
    Thy mild face gazing into mine

    That presence seems before me now
    A placid heaven of sweet moonrise

    When dewlike ou the earth below
    Descends the quiet of the skies

    The calm brow through the parted hair
    The gentle lips which knew no guile

    Softening the blue eyes thoughtful care
    With the bland beavity of their smile

    Ah me  at times that last dread scene
    Of Frost and Fire and moaning Sea

    Will cast its shade of doubt between
    The failing eyes of Faith and thee

    Yet lingering oer thy charmed page
    Where through the twilight air of earth

    Alike enthusiast and sage

    Prophet and bard thou gazest forth

    Lifting the Futures solemn veil

    The reaching of a mortal hand
    To put aside the cold and pale

    Cloudcurtains of the Unseen Land

    In thoughts which answer to my own
    In words which reach my inward ear

    Like whispers from the void Unknown
    I feel thy living presence here

    The waves which lull thy bodys rest
    The dust thy pilgrim footsteps trod

    Unwasted through each change attest
    The fixed economy of God



    Shall these poor elements outlive
    The mind whose kingly will
    wrought

    Their gross unconsciousness survive
    Thy godlike energy of thought

    Thou livest FoUen  not in vain
    Hath tliy fine spirit meekly borne



    they



    The burthen of Lifes cross of pain

    And the thorned crown of suffering worn

    Oh while Lifes solemn mystery glooms
    Around us like a dungeons wall

    Silent earths pale and crowded tombs
    Silent the heaven which bends oer
    all

    While day by day our loved ones glide
    In spectral silence hushed and lone

    To the cold shadows which divide

    The living from the dread Unknown

    While even on the closing eye

    And on the lip which moves in vain

    The seals of that stern mystery
    Their undiscovered trust retain

    And only midst the gloom of death

    Its mournful doubts and haimting fears

    Two pale sweet angels Hope and Faith
    Smile dimly on us through their tears

    T is something to a heart like mine
    To think of thee as living yet

    To feel that such a light as thine
    Could not in utter darkness set

    Less dreary seems the untried way

    Since thou hast left thy footprints there

    And beams of mournful beauty play
    Round the sad Angels sable hair

    Oh  at this hour when half the sky
    Is glorious with its evening light

    And fair broad fields of summer lie
    Hung oer with greenness in my sight

    While throvigh these elmboughs wet with
    rain
    The sunsets golden walls are seen
    With cloverbloom and yellow grain

    And wood draped hill and stream be
    tween

    I long to know if scenes like this
    Are hidden from an angels eyes

    If earths familiar loveliness

    Haunts not thy heavens serener skies

    For sweetly here upon thee grew
    The lesson which that beauty gave

    The ideal of the pure and true

    In earth and sky and gliding wave

    And it may be that all which lends
    The soul an upward impulse here

    With a diviner beauty blends
    And greets us in a holier sphere

    Through groves where blighting never fell
    The humbler flowers of earth may twine

    And simple draughts fiom childhoods well
    Blend with the angeltasted wine

    But be the prying vision veiled
    And let the seeking lips be dumb

    Where even seraph eyes have failed
    Shall mortal blindness seek to come

    We only know that thou hast gone
    And that the same returnless tide

    Which bore thee from us still glides on
    And we who mourn thee with it glide

    On all thou lookest we shall look
    And to our gaze erelong shall turn

    That page of Gods mysterious book
    We so much wish yet dread to learn

    With Him before whose awfxd power
    Thy spirit bent its trembling knee

    Who in the silent greeting flower
    And forest leaf looked out on thee

    We leave thee with a trust serene

    Which Time nor Change nor Death can
    move

    While with thy childlike faith we lean
    On Him whose dearest name is Love



    TO J P

    John Pierpont the eloquent preacher and
    poet of Boston

    Not as a poor requital of the joy

    With which my childhood heard that lay

    of thine
    Whicli like an echo of the song divine
    At Bethlehem breathed above the Holy
    Boy
    Bore to my ear the Airs of Palestine
    Not to the poet but the man I bring
    In friendships fearless trust my offering
    How much it lacks I feel and thou wilt see
    Yet well I know that thou hast deemed with

    me
    Life all too earnest and its time too short



    For dreamy ease and Fancys graceful
    sport
    And girded for thy constant strife with
    wrong
    Like Nehemiah fighting while he wrought
    The broken walls of Zion even thy song
    Hath a rude martial tone a blow in every
    thought



    CHALKLEY HALL

    Chalkley Hall near Frankford Pa was the
    residence of Thomas Chalkley an eminent min
    ister of the Friends denomination He was one
    of the eaily settlers of the Colony and his Jour
    nal which was published in 1741 presents a
    quaint but beautiful picture of a life of unosten
    tatious and simple goodness He was the mas
    ter of a merchant vessel and in his visits to
    the West Indies and Great Britain omitted no
    opportunity to labor for the highest interests of
    his fellowmen During a temporary residence
    in Philadelphia in the summer of I80S the
    quiet and beautiful scenery around the ancient
    village of Frankford frequently attracted me
    from the heat and bustle of the city I have
    referred to my youthful acquaintance with his
    writings in SnowBound

    How bland and sweet the greeting of this
    breeze
    To him who flies
    From crowded street and red walls weary

    gleam
    Till far behind him like a hideous dream
    The close dark city lies

    Here while the market murmurs while men
    throng

    The marble floor
    Of Mammons altar from the crush and din
    Of the worlds madness let me gather in

    My better thoughts once more

    Oh once again revive while on my ear

    The cry of Gain
    And low hoarse hum of Traffic die away
    Ye blessed memories of my early day

    Like sere grass wet with rain

    Once more let Gods green earth and sunset

    air
    Old feelings waken
    Through weary years of toil and strife and

    ill

    PERSONAL POEMS



    Oh let me feel that my good angel still
    Hath not his trust forsaken

    And well do time and place befit my mood

    Beneath the anns
    Of this embracing wood a good man made
    His home like Abraham resting in the shade

    Of Mamres lonely palms

    Here rich with autumn gifts of countless
    years
    The virgin soil
    Turned from the share he guided and in

    rain
    And summer sunshine throve the fruits and
    grain
    Which blessed his honest toil

    Here from his voyages on the stormy seas

    Weary and worn
    He came to meet his children and to bless
    The Giver of all good in thankfulness

    And praise for his retiuni

    And here his neighbors gathered in to greet

    Their friend again
    Safe from the wave and the destroying gales
    Which reap untimely green Bermudas
    vales

    And vex the Carib main

    To hear the good man tell of simple truth

    Sown in an hour
    Of weakness in some faroff Indian isle
    From the parched bosom of a barren soil

    Raised up in life and power

    How at those gatherings in Barbadian vales

    A tendering love
    Came oer him like the gentle rain from

    heaven
    And words of fitness to his lips were given

    And strength as from above

    How the sad captive listened to the Word

    Until his chain
    Grew lighter and his wounded spirit felt
    The liealing balm of consolation melt

    Upon its lifelong pain

    How the armed warrior sat him down to hear

    Of Peace and Truth
    And the proud ruler and his Creole dame
    Jewelled and gorgeous in her beauty came

    And fair and brighteyed youth



    Oh far away beneath New Englands sky

    Even when a boy
    Following my plough by Merrimacs green

    shore
    His simple record I have pondered oer

    With deep and quiet joy

    And hence this scene in sunset glory
    warm
    Its woods around
    Its still stream winding on in light and

    shade
    Its soft green meadows and its upland
    glade
    To me is holy ground

    And dearer far than haunts where Genius
    keeps
    His vigils still
    Than that where Avons son of song is laid
    Or Vaucluse hallowed by its Petrarchs
    shade
    Or Virgils laurelled hill

    To the gray walls of fallen Paraclete

    To Juliets urn
    Fair Arno and Sorrentos orangegrove
    Where Tasso sang let yovmg Romance and
    Love

    Like brother pilgrims turn

    But here a deeper and serener charm

    To all is given
    And blessed memories of the faithful dead
    Oer wood and vale and meadowstream
    have shed

    The holy hues of Heaven



    GONE

    Another hand is beckoning us

    Another call is given
    And glows once more with Angelsteps

    The path which reaches Heaven

    Our young and gentle friend whose smile
    Made brighter summer hours

    Amid the frosts of autumn time
    Has left us with the flowers

    No paling of the cheek of bloom

    Forewarned us of decay
    No shadow from the Silent Land

    Fell round our sisters way



    TO RONGE



    179



    The light of her young life went down

    As sinks behind the hill
    The glory of a setting star

    Clear suddenly and still

    As pure and sweet her fair brow seemed

    Eternal as the skj
    And like the brooks low song her voice

    A sound which could not die

    And half we deemed she needed not

    The changing of her sphere
    To give to Heaven a Shining One

    Who walked an Angel here

    The blessing of her quiet life

    Fell on us like the dew
    And good thoughts where her footsteps
    pressed

    Like fairy blossoms grew

    Sweet promptings unto kindest deeds

    Were in her very look
    We read her face as one who reads

    A true and holy book

    The measure of a blessed hymn
    To which our hearts could move

    The breathing of an inward psalm
    A canticle of love

    We miss her in the place of prayer
    And by the hearthfires light

    We pause beside her door to hear

    Once more her sweet  Goodnight

    There seems a shadow on the day

    Her smile no longer cheers
    A dimness on the stars of night

    Like eyes that look through tears

    Alone unto our Fathers will

    One thought hath reconciled
    That He whose love exceedeth ours

    Hath taken home His child

    Fold her O Father  in Thine arms

    And let her henceforth be
    A messenger of love between

    Our human hearts and Thee

    Still let her mild rebuking stand

    Between us and the wrong
    And her dear memory serve to make

    Our faith in Goodness strong



    And grant that she who trembling here

    Distrusted all her powers
    May welcome to her holier home

    The wellbeloved of ours



    TO RONGE

    This was written after reading the powerful
    and manly protest of Johannes Ronge against
    the  ijious fraud of the Bishop of Treves
    Tlie bold movement of the young Catholic friest
    of Prussian Silesia seemed to me full of promise
    to the caiise of political as well as religious lib
    erty in Europe That it failed was due partly
    to the faults of the reformer but mainly to the
    disagreement of the Liberals of Germany upon
    a matter of dogma which prevented them from
    unity of action Ronge was born in Silesia in
    1818 and died in October 1887 His autobiog
    rapliy was translated into English and published
    in London in 1846

    CHANNING

    The last time I saw Dr Channing was in the
    summer of 1841 when in company with my
    English friend Joseph Sturge so well known
    for his philanthropic labors and liberal political
    opinions I visited him in his summer residence
    in Rhode Island In recalling the impressions
    of that visit it can scarcely be necessary to say
    that I liave no reference to the peculiar reli
    gious opinions of a man whose life beautifully
    and truly manifested above the atmosphere of
    sect is now the worlds common legacy

    Not vainly did old poets tell
    Nor vainly did old genius paint

    Gods great and crowning miracle
    The hero and the saint

    For even in a faithless day

    Can we our sainted ones discern

    And feel while with them on the way
    Our hearts within us burn

    And thus the common tongue and pen
    Which worldwide echo Channings
    fame

    As one of Heavens anointed men
    Have sanctified his name

    In vain shall Rome her portals bar
    And shut from him her saintly prize

    Whom in the worlds great calendar
    All men shall canonize

    By Narragansetts sunny bay

    Beneath his green embowering wood

    To me it seems but yesterday
    Since at his side I stood



    The slopes lay green with summer rains
    The western wind blew fresh and free

    And glimmered down the orchard lanes
    The white surf of the sea

    With us was one who calm and true
    Lifes highest purpose uudeistood

    And like his blessed Master knew
    The joy of doing good

    Unlearned unknown to lettered fame
    Yet on the lips of Englands poor

    And toiling millions dwelt his name
    With blessings evermore

    Unknown to power or place yet where
    The Sim looks oer the Carib sea

    It blended with the freemans prayer
    And song of jubilee

    He told of Englands sin and wrong
    The ills her suffering children know

    The squalor of the citys throng
    The green fields want and woe

    Oer Channings face the tenderness

    Of sympathetic sorrow stole
    Like a still shadow passionless

    The sorrow of the soul

    But when the generous Briton told

    How hearts were answering to his own

    And Freedoms rising murmur rolled
    Up to the dulleared throne

    I saw methought a glad surprise

    Thrill through that frail and painworn
    frame

    And kindling in those deep calm eyes
    A still and earnest flame

    His few brief words were such as move
    The human heart  the Faithsown seeds

    Which ripen in the soil of love
    To high heroic deeds

    No bars of sect or clime were felt

    The Babel strife of tongues had ceased

    And at one common altar knelt
    The Quaker and the priest

    And not in vain  with strength renewed
    And zeal refreshed and hope less dim

    For that brief meeting each pursued
    The path allotted him



    TO MY FRIEND ON THE DEATH OF HIS SISTER



    How echoes yet each Western hill

    And vale with Channings dying word

    How are the hearts of freemen still
    By that great warning stirred

    The stranger treads his native soil
    And pleads with zeal unfelt before

    The honest right of British toil
    The claim of Englands poor

    Before him timewrought barriers fall
    Old fears subside old hatreds melt

    And stretching oer the seas blue wall
    The Saxon greets the Celt

    The yeoman on the Scottish lines

    The Sheffield grinder worn and grim

    The delver in the Cornwall mines
    Look up with hope to him

    Swart smiters of the glowing steel
    Dark feeders of the forges flame

    Pale watchers at the loom and wheel
    Repeat his honored name

    And thus the influence of that hour
    Of converse on Rhode Islands strand

    Lives in the calm resistless power
    Which moves our fatherland

    God blesses still the generous thought
    And still the fitting word He speeds

    And Truth at His requiring taught
    He quickens into deeds

    Where is the victory of the grave

    What dust upon the spirit lies
    God keeps the sacred life he gave

    The prophet never dies



    TO MY FRIEND ON THE DEATH
    OF HIS SISTER

    Sophia Sturge sister of Joseph Sfcurge of
    Birmingham the President of the British Com
    plete Suffrage Association died in the 6th
    month 1845 She was the colleague counsel
    lor and everready helpmate of her brother
    in all his vast designs of beneficence The
    Hirmingham Pilot says of her Never per
    haps were the active and passive virtues of
    the human character more harmoniously and
    beautifully blended than in this excellent wo
    man



    Thine is a grief the depth of which an
    other

    May never know
    Yet oer the waters O my stricken brother

    To thee I go

    1 lean my heart imto thee sadly folding

    Thy band in mine
    With even the weakness of my soul uphold
    ing

    The strength of thine

    I never knew like thee the dear departed

    I stood not by
    When in calm trust the pure and tranquil
    hearted

    Lay down to die

    And on thy ears my words of weak condol
    ing
    Must vainly fall
    The funeral bell which in thy heart is toll

    Sounds over all

    I will not mock thee with the poor worlds
    common

    And heartless phrase
    Nor wrong the memory of a sainted woman

    With idle praise

    With silence only as their benediction

    Gods angels come
    Where in the shadow of a great affliction

    The soul sits dumb

    Yet would I say what thy own heart ap
    proveth
    Our Fathers will
    Calling to Him the dear one whom He lov
    eth
    Is mercy still

    Not ujjon thee or thine the solemn angel

    Hath evil wrought
    Her funeral anthem is a glad evangel

    The good die not

    God calls our loved ones but we lose not
    wholly
    What He hath given
    They live on earth in thought and deed as
    truly
    As in His heaven

    And she is with thee  in thy path of trial

    She walketh yet
    Still with the baptism of thy selfdenial

    Her locks are wet

    Up then my brother  Lo the fields of

    She lives and loves thee and the God thou

    Shall olean beside



    DANIEL WHEELER

    Daniel Wheeler a minister of the Society of
    Friends who had labored in the cause of his
    Divine Master in Great Britain Russia and
    the islands of the Pacific died in New York in
    the spring of 1840 while on a religious visit to
    this country

    O DEARLY loved
    And worthy of our love  No more
    Thy aged form shall rise before
    The hushed and waiting worshipper
    In meek obedience utterance giving
    To words of truth so fresh and living
    That even to the inward sense
    They bore unquestioned evidence
    Of an anointed Messenger
    Or bowing down thy silver hair
    In reverent awfulness of prayer

    The world its time and sense shut out
    The brightness of Faiths holy trance
    Gathered upon thy countenance

    As if each lingering cloud of doubt
    The cold dark shadows resting here
    In Times unluminous atmosphere

    Were lifted by an angels hand
    And through them on thy spiritual eye
    Shone down the blessedness on high

    The glory of the Better Land

    The oak has fallen
    While meet for no good work the vine
    May yet its worthless branches twine
    Who knoweth not that with thee fell
    A great man in our Israel



    Fallen while thy loins were girded still

    Thy feet with Zions dews still wet

    And in thy hand retaining yet
    The pilgrims staif and scallopshell
    Unharmed and safe where wild and free

    Across the Nevas cold morass
    The breezes from the Frozen Sea

    With winters arrowy keenness pass
    Or where the unwaruing tropic gale
    Smote to the waves thy tattered sail
    Or where the noonhours fervid heat
    Against Tahitis mountains beat

    The same mysterious Hand which gave

    Deliverance upon land and wave
    Tempered for thee the blasts which blew

    Ladagas frozen surface oer
    And blessed for thee the baleful dew

    Of evening upon Eimeos shore
    Beneath tliis sunny heaven of ours
    Midst our soft airs and opening flowers

    Hath given thee a grave

    His will be done
    Who seeth not as man whose way

    Is not as ours  T is well with thee
    Nor anxiovis doubt nor dark dismay
    Disquieted thy closing day
    But evermore thy soul could say

    My Father careth still for me
    Called from thy hearth and home  from
    her

    The last bud on thy household tree
    The last dear one to minister

    In duty and in love to tliee
    From all which nature holdeth dear

    Feeble with years and worn with pain

    To seek our distant land again
    Bound in the spirit yet unknowing

    The things wliich should befall thee here

    Whether for labor or for death
    In childlike trust serenely going

    To that last trial of thy faith

    Oh far away
    Where never sliines our Northern star

    On that dark waste which Balboa saw
    From Darieus mountains stretching far
    So strange heavenbroad and lone that

    there
    With forehead to its damp wind bare

    He bent his mailed knee in awe
    In many an isle whose coral feet
    The surges of that ocean beat
    In thy palm shadows Oahu

    And Honolulus silver bay

    Amidst Owyhees hills of blue

    And tarojjlaiiis of Tooboonai
    Are geutle hearts which long shall be
    Sad as our owu at thought of thee
    Worn sowers of Truths holy seed
    Whose souls in weariness and need

    Were strengthened and refreshed by
    thine
    For blessed by our Fathers hand

    Was thy deep love and tender care

    Thy ministry and fervent prayer
    Grateful as Eshcols clustered vine
    To Israel in a weary land

    And they who drew
    By thousands round thee in the hour

    Of prayerful waiting hushed and deep

    That He who bade the islands keep
    Silence before Him might renew

    Their strength with His unslumbering
    power
    They too shall mourn that thou art gone

    That nevermore thy aged lip
    Shall soothe the weak the erring warn
    Of those who first rejoicing heard
    Through thee the Gospels glorious word

    Seals of thy true apostleship
    And if the brightest diadem

    Whose gems of glory purely burn

    Around the ransomed ones in bliss
    Be evermore reserved for them

    Who here through toil and sorrow
    turn

    Many to righteousness
    May we not think of thee as wearing
    That starlike crown of light and bear
    ing
    Amidst Heavens white and blissful band
    Th unfading palmbranch in thy hand
    And joining with a seraphs tongue
    In that new song the elders sung
    Ascribing to its blessed Giver
    Thanksgiving love and praise forever

    Farewell
    And though the ways of Zion mourn
    When her strong ones are called away
    Who like thyself have calmly borne
    The heat and burden of the day
    Yet He who slumbereth not nor sleepeth
    His ancient watch around us keepeth
    Still sent from His creating hand
    New witnesses for Truth shall stand
    New instruments to sound abroad
    The Gospel of a risen Lord



    To gather to the fold once more
    The desolate and gone astray
    The scattered of a cloudy day

    And Zions broken walls restore
    And through the travail and the toil

    Of true obedience minister
    Beauty for ashes and the oil

    Of joy for mourning unto her
    So shall her holy bounds increase
    With walls of praise and gates of peace
    So shall the Vine which martyr tears
    And blood sustained in other years

    With fresher life be clothed upon
    And to the world in beauty show
    Like the roseplant of Jericho

    And glorious as Lebanon

    learned to love as a friend

    Seeress of the misty Norland
    Daughter of the Vikings bold

    Welcome to the sunny Vineland
    Which thy fathers sought of old

    Soft as flow of Siljas waters

    When the moon of summer shines

    Strong as Winter from his mountains
    Roaring through the sleeted pines

    Heart and ear we long have listened

    To thy saga rune and song
    As a household joy and presence

    We have known and loved thee long

    By the mansions marble mantel

    Round the logwalled cabins hearth

    Thy sweet thoughts and northern fancies
    Meet and mingle with our mirth

    And oer weary spirits keeping

    Sorrows nightwatch long and chill

    Shine they like thy sun of summer
    Over midnight vale and hill

    We alone to thee are strangers
    Thou our friend and teacher art

    Come and know us as we know thee
    Let us meet thee heart to heart

    TO AVIS KEENE

    ON RECEIVING A BASKET OF SEAMOSSES

    Thanks for thy gift

    Of ocean flowers
    Born where the golden drift
    Of the slant sunshine falls
    Down the green tremulous walls
    Of water to the cool still coral bowers
    Where under rainbows of perpetual
    showers
    Gods gardens of the deep
    His patient angels keep
    Gladdening the dim strange solitude
    With fairest forms and hues and thus
    Forever teaching us
    The lesson which the manycolored skies
    The flowers and leaves and painted butter
    flies
    The deers branched antlers the gay bird

    that flings
    The tropic sunshine from its golden wings
    The brightness of the human countenance
    Its play of smiles the magic of a glance
    Forevermore repeat
    In varied tones and sweet
    That beauty in and of itself is good

    O kind and generous friend oer whom
    The sunset hues of Time are cast
    Painting upon the overpast
    And scattered clouds of noonday sorrow
    The promise of a fairer morrow
    An earnest of the better life to come
    The binding of the spirit broken
    The warning to the erring spoken

    The comfort of the sad
    The eye to see the hand to cull
    Of common things the beautiful

    The absent heart made glad
    By simple gift or graceful token
    Of love it needs as daily food
    All own one Source and all are good
    Hence tracking sunny cove and reach
    Where spent waves glimmer up tlie

    beach
    And toss their gifts of weed and shell
    From foamy curve and combing swell



    No unbefitting task was thine

    To weave these flowers so soft and
    fair
    In unison with His design

    Who loveth beauty everywhere
    And makes in every zone and clime

    In ocean and in upper air
    All things beautiful in their time

    For not alone in tones of awe and power

    He speaks to man
    The cloudy horror of the thundershower
    His rainbows span
    And where the caravan
    Winds oer the desert leaving as in air
    The craneflock leaves no trace of passage
    there
    He gives the weary eye
    The palmleaf shadow for the hot noon
    hours
    And on its branches dry
    Calls out the acacias flowers
    And where the dark shaft pierces down

    Beneath the mountain roots
    Seen by the miners lamp alone
    The starlike crystal shoots
    So where the winds and waves below
    The coralbianched gardens grow
    His climbing weeds and mosses show
    Like foliage on each stony bough
    Of varied hues more strangely gay
    Than forest leaves in autumns day
    Thus evermore
    On sky and wave and shore
    An allpervading beauty seems to say
    Gods love and power are one  and

    they
    Who like the thunder of a sultry day
    Smite to restore
    And they who like the gentle wind uplift
    The petals of the dewwet flowers and drift

    Their perfume on the air
    Alike may serve Him each with their own

    Making their lives a prayer



    THE HILLTOP

    The burly driver at my side
    We slowly climbed the liill

    Whose summit in the hot noontide
    Seemed rising rising still

    At last our short noonshadows hid
    The topstone bare and brown

    From whence like Gizehs pyramid
    The rough mass slanted down

    I felt the cool breath of the North

    Between me and the sun
    Oer deep still lake and ridgy earth

    I saw the cloudshades rim
    Before me stretched for glistening miles

    Lay mountaingirdled Squam
    Like greenwinged birds the leafy isles

    Upon its bosom swam

    And glimmering through the sunhaze
    warm

    Far as the eye could roam
    Dark billows of an earthquake storm

    Beflecked with clouds like foam
    Their vales in misty shadow deep

    Their rugged peaks in shine
    I saw the mountain ranges sweep

    The horizons northern line

    There towered Chocoruas peak  and west

    Moosehillocks woods were seen
    With many a nameless slidescarred crest

    And pinedark gorge between
    Beyond them like a sunrimmed cloud

    The great Notch mountains shone
    Watched over by the solemnbrowed

    And awful face of stone

    A good lookoff   the driver spake

    About this time last year
    I drove a party to the Lake

    And stopped at evening here
    T was duskisli down below  but all

    These hills stood in the sun
    Till dipped behind yon purjjle wall

    He left them one by one

    A lady who from Thornton hill

    Had held her place outside
    And as a pleasant woman will

    Had cheered the long dull ride
    Besought me with so sweet a smile

    That  though I hate delays
    I could not choose but rest awhile

    These women have such ways I

    On yonder mossy ledge she sat

    Her sketch upon her knees
    A stray brown lock beneath her hat

    Unrolling in the breeze
    Her sweet face in the sunset light



    Upraised and glorified
    I never saw a prettier sight
    In all my mountain ride

    As good as fair  it seemed her joy

    To comfort and to give
    My poor sick wife and cripple boy

    Will bless her while they live
    The tremor in the drivers tone

    His manhood did not shame
    I dare say sir you may have known

    He named a wellknown name

    Then sank the pyramidal mounds

    The blue lake fled away
    For mountainscope a parlors bounds

    A lighted hearth for day
    From lonely years and weary miles

    The shadows fell apart
    Kind voices cheered sweet human smiles

    Shone warm into my heart

    We journeyed on  but earth and sky

    Had power to charm no more
    Still dreamed my inwardturning eye

    The dream of memory oer
    Ah  human kindness human love

    To few who seek denied
    Too late we learn to prize above

    The whole roimd world beside



    ELLIOTT

    Ebenezer Elliott was to the artisans of Eng
    land what Burns was to the peasantry of Scot
    land His Cornlaw Bhymes contributed not a
    little to that overwhelming tide of popular
    opinion and feeling wliicli resulted in the repeal
    of the tax on bread Well has the eloquent
    author of The Beforms and Beformers of Great
    Britain said of him  Not cornlaw repealers
    alone but all Britons who moisten their scanty
    bread with the sweat of the brow are largely
    indebted to his inspiring lay for the mighty
    bound which the laboring mind of England
    has taken in our day

    Hands off  thou tithefat plunderer  play

    No trick of priestcraft here
    Back puny lordling  darest thou lay

    A hand on Elliotts bier
    Alive your rank and pomp as dust

    Beneath his feet he trod
    He knew the locust swarm that cursed

    The harvestfields of God

    PERSONAL POEMS



    On these pale lips the saiothered thought

    Which Englands millions feel
    A fierce and fearful splendor caught

    As from his forge the steel
    Strongarmed as Thor a shower of fire

    His smitten anvil flimg
    Gods curse Earths wrong dumb Hungers
    ire

    He gave them all a tongue

    Then let the poor mans horny hands

    Bear up the mighty dead
    And labors swart and stalwart bauds

    Behind as mourners tread
    Leave cant and craft their baptized bounds

    Leave rank its minster floor
    Give Englands green and daisied grounds

    The poet of the poor

    Lay down upon his Sheafs green verge

    That brave old heart of oak
    With fitting dirge from sounding forge

    And pall of furnace smoke
    Where whirls the stone its dizzy rounds

    And axe and sledge are swung
    And timing to their stormy sounds

    His stormy lays are sung

    There let the peasants step be heard

    The grinder chant his rhyme
    Nor patrons praise nor dainty word

    Befits the man or time
    No soft lament nor dreamers sigh

    For him whose words were bread
    The Runic rhyme and spell whereby

    The foodless poor were fed

    Pile up the tombs of rank and pride

    O England as thou wilt
    With pomp to nameless worth denied

    Emblazon titled guilt
    No part or lot in these we claim

    But oer the sounding wave
    A common right to Elliotts name

    A freehold in his grave

    ICHABOD

    This poem was the outcome of the surprise
    and grief and forecast of evil consequences
    which I felt on reading the seventh of March
    speech of Daniel Webster in supjjoit of the
    compromise and the Fugitive Slave Law
    No partisan or personal enmity dictated it
    On the contrary my admiration of the splendid
    personality and intellectual power of the great



    Senator was never stronger than when I laid
    down his speech and in one of the saddest
    moments of my life penned my protest I
    saw as I wrote with painful clearness its sure
    results  the Slave Power anogant and defi
    ant strengthened and encouraged to carry out
    its scheme for the extension of its balefid sys
    tem or the dissolution of the Union the guar
    anties of personal liberty in the free JStates
    broken down and the whole country made the
    huntingground of slavecatchers In the hor
    ror of such a vision so soon fearfully fulfilled
    if one spoke at all he could only speak in tones
    of stern and sorrowful rebuke

    But death softens all resentments and the
    consciousness of a common inheritance of frail
    ty and weakness modifies the severity of
    judgment Years after in The Lost Occasion
    I gave utterance to an almost universal regret
    that the great statesman did not live to see the
    flag which he loved trampled under the feet of
    Slavery and in view of this desecration make
    his last days glorious in defence of  Liberty
    and Union one and inseparable

    So fallen  so lost  the light withdrawn

    Which once he wore
    The gloiy from his gray hairs gone

    Forevermore

    Revile him not the Tempter hath

    A snare for all
    And pitying tears not scorn and wrath

    Befit his fall

    Oh dumb be passions stormy rage

    When he who might
    Have lighted up and led his age

    Falls back in night

    Scorn  would the angels laugh to mark

    A bright soul driven
    Fiendgoaded down the endless dark

    From hope and heaven

    Let not the land once proud of him

    Insult him now
    Nor brand with deeper shame his dim

    Dishonored brow

    But let its humbled sons instead

    From sea to lake
    A long lament as for the dead

    In sadness make

    Of all we loved and honored naught
    Save power remains



    THE LOST OCCASION



    187



    A fallen angels pride of thought
    Still strong in chains

    All else is gone  from those great eyes

    The soul has fled
    When faith is lost when honor dies

    The man is dead

    Then pay the reverence of old days

    To his dead fame
    Walk backward with averted gaze

    And hide the shame



    THE LOST OCCASION

    Some die too late and some too soon
    At early morning heat of noon
    Or the chill evening twilight Thou
    Whom the rich heavens did so endow
    With eyes of power and Joves own

    brow
    With all the massive strength that fills
    Thy homehorizons granite hills
    With rarest gifts of heart and head
    From manliest stock inherited
    New Englands stateliest type of man
    In port and speech Olympian
    Whom no one met at first but took
    A second awed and wondering look
    As turned perchance the eyes of Greece
    On Phidias unveiled masterpiece
    Whose words in simplest homespun clad
    The Saxon strength of Cjedmons had
    With power reserved at need to reach
    The Roman forums loftiest speech
    Sweet with persuasion eloquent
    In passion cool in argument
    Or ponderous falling on thy foes
    As fell the Norse gods hammer blows
    Crushing as if with Talus flail
    Through Errors logicwoven mail
    And failing only when they tried
    The adamant of the righteous side
    Thou foiled in aim and hope bereaved
    Of old friends by the new deceived
    Too soon for us too soon for thee
    Beside thy lonely Northern sea
    Where long and low the marshlands spread
    Laid wearily down thy august head

    Thou shouldst have lived to feel below
    Thy feet Disunions fierce upthrow



    The latesprung mine that underlaid

    Thy sad concessions vainly made

    Thou shouldst have seen from Sumters

    wall
    The starflag of the Union fall
    And armed rebellion pressing on
    The broken lines of Washington
    No stronger voice than thine had then
    Called out the utmost might of men
    To make the Unions charter free
    And strengthen law by liberty
    How had that stern arbitrament
    To thy gray age youths vigor lent
    Shaming ambitions paltry prize
    Before thy disillusioned eyes
    Breaking the spell about thee wound
    Like the green withes that Samson

    bound
    Redeeming in one efiort grand
    Thyself and thy imperilled land
    Ah cruel fate that closed to thee
    O sleeper by the Northern sea
    The gates of opportunity
    God fills the gaps of human need
    Each crisis brings its word and deed
    Wise men and strong we did not lack
    But still with memory turning back
    Li the dark hours we thought of thee
    And thy lone grave beside the sea

    Above that grave the east winds blow

    And from the marshlands driftuig slow

    The seafog comes with evermore

    The wavewash of a lonely shore

    And seabirds melancholy cry

    As Nature fain would typify

    The sadness of a closing scene

    The loss of that which should have been

    But where thy native mountains bare

    Their foreheads to diviner air

    Fit emblem of enduring fame

    One lofty summit keeps thy name

    For thee the cosmic forces did

    The rearing of that pyramid

    The prescient ages shaping with

    Fire flood and frost thy monolith

    Sunrise and sunset lay thereon

    With hands of light their benison

    The stars of midnight pause to set

    Their jewels in its coronet

    And evermore that mountain mass

    Seems climbing from the shadowy pass

    To light as if to manifest

    Thy nobler self thy life at best

    LEAF OF HIS



    Dear friends who read the world aright
    And in its common forms discern

    A beauty and a harmony
    The many never learn

    Kindred in soul of him who found
    In simple flower and leaf and stone

    The impulse of the sweetest lays
    Our Saxon tongue has known

    Accept this record of a life

    As sweet and pure as calm and good
    As a long day of blandest June

    In green field and in wood

    How welcome to our ears long pained
    By strife of sect and party noise

    The brooklike murmur of his song
    Of natures simple joys

    The violet by its mossy stone

    The primrose by the rivers brim

    And chancesown daffodil have foimd
    Immortal life through him

    The sunrise on his breezy lake
    The rosy tints his sunset brought

    Worldseen are gladdening all the vales
    And mountainpeaks of thought

    Art builds on sand  the works of pride
    And human passion change and fall

    But that which shares the life of God
    With Him surviveth all

    Fair Natures priestesses  to whom
    In hieroglyph of bud and bloom

    Her mysteries are told
    Who wise in lore of wood and mead
    The seasons pictured scrolls can read

    In lessons manifold

    Thanks for the courtesy and gay
    Goodhumor which on Washing Day
    Our illtimed visit bore



    Thanks for your graceful oars which broke
    The morning dreams of Artichoke
    Along his wooded shore

    Varied as varying Natures ways
    Sprites of the river woodland fays

    Or mountain nymphs ye seem
    Freelimbed Dianas on the green
    Loch Katrines Ellen or Undine

    Upon your favorite stream

    The forms of which the poets told
    The fair benignities of old

    Were doubtless such as you
    What more than Artichoke the rill
    Of Helicon  Than Pipestave hill

    Arcadias mountainview

    No sweeter bowers the bee delayed
    In wild Hymettus scented shade

    Than those you dwell among
    Snowflowered azaleas intertwined
    With roses over banks inclined

    With trembling harebells hung

    A charmed life unknown to death
    Immortal freshness Nature hath

    Her fabled fount and glen
    Are now and here  Dodonas shrine
    Still murmurs in the windswept pine

    All is that eer hath been

    The Beauty which old Greece or Rome
    Sung painted wrought lies close at home

    We need but eye and ear
    In all our daily walks to trace
    The outlines of incarnate grace

    The hymns of gods to hear



    IN PEACE

    A TRACK of moonlight on a quiet lake
    Whose small waves on a silversanded

    shore
    Whisper of peace and with the low winds

    A slumberous stretch of mountainland far

    seen
    Where the low westering clay with gold

    and green
    Purple and amber softly blended fills
    The wooded vales and melts among the

    hills
    A vinefrmged river winding to its rest
    On the calm bosom of a stormless sea
    Bearing alike upon its placid breast
    With earthly flowers and heavenly stars im
    pressed
    The hues of time and of eternity
    Such are the pictures which the thought of

    thee
    O friend awakeneth  charming the keen
    pain
    Of thy departure and our sense of loss
    Requiting with the fullness of thy gain
    Lo  on the quiet grave thy lifeborne
    cross
    Dropped only at its side methinks doth

    shine
    Of thy beatitude the radiant sign

    No sob of grief no wild lament be there
    To break the Sabbath of the holy air
    But in their stead the silentbreathing

    prayer
    Of hearts still waiting for a rest like thine
    O spirit redeemed  Forgive us if hence
    forth
    With sweet and pure similitudes of earth
    We keep thy pleasant memory freshly
    green
    Of loves inheritance a priceless part

    Gods love and peace be with thee where
    Soeer this soft autumnal air
    Lifts the dark tresses of thy hair

    Its kiss to thee in crowded rooms
    Or out among the woodland blooms

    All keep thy memory fresh and green

    Whereer I look whereer I stray
    Thy thought goes with me on my way
    And hence the prayer I breathe today

    Oer lapse of time and change of scene
    The weary waste which lies between
    Thyself and me my heart I lean

    Thou lackst not Friendships spell word

    nor

    All hearts to thine by Loves sweet law

    With these good gifts of God is cast
    Thy lot and many a charm thou hast
    To hold the blessed angels fast

    If then a fervent wish for thee

    The gracious heavens will heed from me

    What should dear heart its burden be

    The sighing of a shaken reed
    What can I more than meekly plead
    The greatness of our common need

    Gods love  unchanging puie and true
    The Paraclete whiteshining through
    His peace  the fall of Hermons dew

    With such a prayer on this sweet day
    As thou mayst hear and I may say
    I greet thee dearest far away

    AN EPISTLE NOT AFTER THE MANNER
    OF HORACE

    These lines were addressed to my worthy
    friend Joshua Coffin teacher historian and an
    tiquarian He was one of the twelve persons
    who with William Lloyd Garrison formed the
    first antislavery society in New England

    Drop times snowflakes on thy crown
    Never be thy shadow less



    Never fail thy cheerfulness
    Care that kills the cat may plough
    Wrinkles in the misers brow
    Deepen envys spiteful frown
    Draw the mouths of bigots down
    Plague ambitions dream and sit
    Heavy on the hypocrite
    Haunt the rich mans door and ride
    In the gilded coach of pride
    Let the fiend pass   what can he
    Find to do with such as thee
    Seldom comes that evil guest
    Where the conscience lies at rest
    And brown health and quiet wit
    Smiling on the threshold sit

    I the urchin unto whom
    In that smoked and dingy room
    Where the district gave thee rule
    Oer its ragged winter school
    Thou didst teach the mysteries
    Of those weary A B Cs
    Where to fill the every pause
    Of thy wise and learned saws
    Through the cracked and crazy wall
    Came the cradlerock and squall
    And the goodmans voice at strife
    With his shrill and tipsy wife
    Luring us by stories old
    With a comic unction told
    More than by the eloquence
    Of terse birchen arguments
    Doubtful gain I fear to look
    With complacence on a book
    Where the genial pedagogue
    Half forgot his rogues to flog
    Citing tale or apologue
    Wise and merry in its drift
    As was Phfedrus twofold gift
    Had the little rebels known it
    Risum et prudentiam monet
    I  the man of middle years
    In whose sable locks appears
    Many a warning fleck of gray
    Looking back to that far day
    And thy primal lessons feel
    Grateful smiles my lips unseal
    As remembering thee I blend

    Threshing Times neglected sheaves
    Gathering up the scattered leaves
    Which the wrinkled sibyl cast
    Careless from her as she passed
    Twofold citizen art thou
    Freeman of the past and now
    He who bore thy name of old
    Midway in the heavens did hold
    Over Gibeon moon and sun
    Thou hast bidden them backward run
    Of today the present ray
    Flinging over yesterday

    Let the busy ones deride
    What I deem of right thy pride
    Let the fools their treadmills grind
    Look not forward nor behind
    Shuffle in and wriggle out
    Veer with every breeze about
    Turning like a windmill sail
    Or a dog that seeks his tail
    Let them laugh to see thee fast
    Tabernacled in the Past
    Working out with eye and lip
    Riddles of old penmanship
    Patient as Belzoui there
    Sorting out with loving care
    Mummies of dead questions stripped
    From their sevenfold manuscript

    Dabbling in their noisy way

    In the puddles of today

    Little know they of that vast

    Solemn ocean of the past

    On whose margin wreckbespread

    Thou art walkmg with the dead

    Questioning the stranded years

    Waking smiles by turns and tears

    As thou callest up again

    Shapes the dust has long oerlain

    Fairhaired woman bearded man

    Cavalier and Puritan

    lu an age whose eager view

    Seeks but present things and new

    Mad for party sect and gold

    Teaching reverence for the old

    On that shore with fowlers tact
    Coolly bagging fact on fact
    Naught amiss to thee can float
    Tale or song or anecdote
    Village gossip centuries old
    Scandals by our grandams told
    What the pilgrims table spread
    Where he lived and whom he wed



    Longdrawn bill of wine and beer
    For his ordination cheer
    Or the flip that wellnigh made
    Glad his fvmeral cavalcade
    Weary prose and poets lines
    Flavored by their age like wines
    Eulogistic of some quaint
    Doubtful Puritanic saint
    Lays that quickened husking jigs
    Jests that shook grave periwigs
    When the parson had his jokes
    And his glass like other folks
    Sermons that for mortal hours
    Taxed our fathers vital powers
    As the long niueteenthlies poured
    Downward from the soundingboard
    And for fire of Pentecost
    Touched their beards Decembers frost

    Time is hastening on and we
    What our fathers are shall be
    Shadowshapes of memory
    Joined to that vast multitude
    Where the great are but the good
    And the mind of strength shall prove
    Weaker than the heart of love
    Pride of graybeard wisdom less
    Than the infants guilelessness
    And his song of sorrow more
    Than the crown the Psalmist wore
    Who shall then with pious zeal
    At our mossgrown thresholds kneel
    From a stained and stony page
    Reading to a careless age
    With a patient eye like thine
    Prosing tale and limping line
    Names and words the hoary rime
    Of the Past has made sublime
    Who shall work for us as well
    The antiquarians miracle
    Who to seeming life recall
    Teacher grave and pupil small
    Who shall give to thee and me
    Freeholds in futurity

    Well whatever lot be mine
    Long and happy days be thine
    Ere thy full and honored age
    Dates of time its latest page
    Squire for master State for school
    Wisely lenient live and rule
    Over grownup knave and rogue
    Play the watchful pedagogue
    Or while pleasure smiles on duty
    At the call of youth and beauty

    Ancient tome and record oer

    Who to wit like that of South
    And the Syrians golden mouth
    Doth the homely pathos add
    Which the pilgrim preachers had
    Breaking like a child at play
    Gilded idols of the day
    Cant of knave and pomp of fool
    Tossing with his ridicule
    Yet in earnest or in jest
    Ever keeping truth abreast
    And when thou art called at last
    To thy townsmen of the past
    Not as stranger shalt thou come
    Thou shalt find thyself at home
    With the little and the big
    Woollen cap and periwig
    Madam in her highlaced ruff
    Goody in her homemade stuff
    Wise and simple rich and poor
    Thou hast known them all before



    THE CROSS

    Richard Dillingham a young member of the
    Society of Friends died in the Nashville peni
    tentiary wheie he was confined for the act of
    aiding the escape of fugitive slaves

    The cross if rightly borne shall be
    No burden but support to thee
    So moved of old time for our sake
    The holy monk of Kempen spake

    Thou brave and true one  upon whom
    Was laid the cross of martyrdom
    How didst thou in thy generous youth
    Bear witness to this blessed truth

    Thy cross of suffering and of shame
    A staff within thy hands became



    In paths where faith alone could see
    The Masters steps supporting thee

    Thine was the seedtime  God alone
    Beholds the end of what is sowai
    Beyond our vision weak and dim
    The harvesttime is hid with Him

    Yet unforgotten where it lies
    That seed of generous sacrifice
    Though seeming on the desert cast
    Shall rise with bloom and fruit at last

    THE HERO

    The hero of the incident related in this poem
    was Dr Samuel Gridley Howe the wellknown
    philanthropist who when a young man volun
    teered his aid in the Greek struggle for inde
    pendence

    Oh for a knight like Bayard
    Without reproach or fear
    My light glove on his casque of steel
    My loveknot on his spear

    Oh for the white plume floating
    Sad Zutphens field above
    The lion heart in battle

    The womans heart in love

    Oh that man once more were manly
    Womans pride and not her scorn
    That once more the pale young mother
    Dared to boast  a man is born

    But now lifes slumberous ciirrent
    No sunbowed cascade wakes
    No tall heroic manhood
    The level dulness breaks

    Oh for a knight like Bayard
    Without reproach or fear
    My light glove on his casque of steel
    My loveknot on his spear

    Then I said my own heart throbbing
    To the time her proud pidse beat
    Life hath its regal natures yet
    True tender brave and sweet

    Smile not fair unbeliever
    One man at least I know
    Who might wear the crest of Bayard
    Or Sidneys plume of snow



    RANTOUL



    193



    Once when over purple mountains

    Died away the Grecian sun
    And the far Cyllenian ranges

    Paled and darkened one by one

    Fell the Turk a bolt of thunder

    Cleaving all the quiet sky
    And against his sharp steel lightnings

    Stood the Suliote but to die

    Woe for the weak and halting

    The crescent blazed behind
    A curving line of sabres

    Like fire before the wind

    Last to fly and first to rally

    Rode he of whom I speak
    When groaning in his bridlepath

    Sauk down a wounded Greek

    With the rich Albanian costume
    Wet with many a ghastly stain

    Gazing on earth and sky as one
    Who might not gaze again

    He looked forward to the mountains
    Back on foes that never spare

    Then flung him from his saddle
    And placed the stranger there

    Allah  hu   Through flashing sabres
    Through a stormy hail of lead

    The good Thessalian charger
    Up the slopes of olives sped

    Hot spurred the turbaned riders

    He almost felt their breath
    Where a mountain stream rolled darkly
    down

    Between the hills and death

    One brave and manful struggle

    He gained the solid land
    And the cover of the mountains

    And the carbines of his band

    It was very great and noble
    Said the moisteyed listener then

    But one brave deed makes no hero
    Tell me what he since hath been

    Still a brave and generous manhood

    Still an honor without stain
    In the prison of the Kaiser

    By the barricades of Seine



    But dream not helm and harness

    The sign of valor true
    Peace hath higher tests of manhood

    Than battle ever knew

    Wouldst know him now  Behold him

    The Cadmus of the blind
    Giving the dumb lip language

    The idiotclay a mind

    Walking his round of duty

    Serenely day by day
    With the strong mans liand of labor

    And childhoods heart of play

    True as the knights of story

    Sir Lancelot and his peers
    Brave in his calm endurance

    As they in tilt of spears

    As waves in stillest waters

    As stars in noonday skies
    All that wakes to noble action

    In his noon of calmness lies

    Wherever outraged Nature

    Asks word or action brave
    Wherever struggles labor

    Wherever groans a slave

    Wherever rise the peoples

    Wherever sinks a throne
    The throbbing heart of Freedom finds

    An answer in his own

    Knight of a better era

    Without reproach or fear
    Said I not well that Bayards

    And Sidneys still are here



    RANTOUL

    No more fitting inscription could be placed
    on the tombstone of Robert Rantoul than this
    He died at his post in Congress and his last
    words were a protest in the name of Democracy
    against the FugitiveSlave Law

    One day along the electric wire

    His manly word for Freedom sped

    We came next morn  that tongue of fire
    Said only  He who spake is dead

    Dead  while his voice was living yet
    In echoes round the pillared dome

    PERSONAL POEMS



    Dead  while his blotted page lay wet
    With themes of state and loves of home

    Dead  in that crowning grace of time
    That triumph of lifes zenith hour

    Dead  while we watched his manhoods
    prime
    Break from the slow bud into flower

    Dead  he so great and strong and wise
    While the mean thousands yet drew
    breath

    How deepened through that dread surprise
    The mystery and the awe of death

    From the high place whereon our votes
    Had borne him clear calm earnest fell

    His first words like the prelude notes
    Of some great anthem yet to swell

    We seemed to see our flag unfurled
    Our champion waiting in his place

    For the last battle of the world
    The Armageddon of the race

    Through him we hoped to speak the word
    Which wins the freedom of a land

    And lift for human right the sword

    Which dropped from Hampdens dying
    hand

    For he had sat at Sidneys feet

    And walked with Pym and Vane apart
    And through the centuries felt the beat

    Of Freedoms march in Cromwells
    heart

    He knew the paths the worthies held
    Where Englands best and wisest trod

    And lingering drank the springs that
    welled
    Beneath the touch of Miltons rod

    No wild enthusiast of the right

    Selfpoised and clear he showed alway

    The coolness of his northern night
    The ripe repose of autumns day

    His steps were slow yet forward still
    He pressed where others paused or failed

    The calm star clomb with constant will
    The restless meteor flashed and paled

    Skilled in its subtlest wile he knew
    And owned the higher ends of Law



    Still rose majestic on his view

    The awful Shape the schoolman saw

    Her home the heart of God  her voice

    The choral harmonies whereby
    The stars through all their spheres rejoice

    The rhythmic rule of earth and sky

    We saw his great powers misapplied
    To poor ambitions  yet through all

    We saw him take the weaker side

    And right the wronged and free the
    thrall

    Now looking oer the frozen North
    For one like him in word and act

    To call her old free spirit forth

    And give her faith the life of fact

    To break her party bonds of shame
    And labor with the zeal of him

    To make the Democratic name
    Of Liberty the synonyme

    We sweep the land from hill to strand
    We seek the strong the wise the brave

    And sad of heart return to stand
    In silence by a newmade grave

    There where his breezy hills of home
    Look out upon his sailwhite seas

    The sounds of winds and waters come
    And shape themselves to words like
    these

    Why murmuring mourn that he whose
    power

    Was lent to Party overlong
    Heard the still whisper at the hour

    He set his foot on Party wrong

    The human life that closed so well
    No lapse of folly now can stain

    The lips whence Freedoms protest fell
    No meaner thought can now profane

    Mightier than living voice his grave
    That lofty protest utters oer

    Through roaring wind and smiting wave
    It speaks his hate of wrong once more

    Men of the North  your weak regret
    Is wasted here  arise and pay

    To freedom and to him your debt

    By following where he led the way

    WILLIAM FORSTER

    William Forster of Norwich England died
    in East Tennessee in the 1st month 1854 while
    engaged in presenting to the governors of the
    States of this Union the address of his religions
    society on the evils of slavery He was the
    relative and coadjutor of the Buxtons Gurneys
    and Frys  and his Avhole life extending almost
    to threescore and ten years was a pure and
    beautiful example of Christian benevolence
    He had travelled over Europe and visited most
    of its sovereigns to plead against the slave
    trade and slavery  and had twice before made
    visits to this country under impressions of re
    ligious duty He was the father of the Right
    Hon WiUiam Edward Forster He visited my
    fathers house in Haverhill during his first tour
    in the United States

    The years are many since his hand

    Was laid upon my head
    Too weak and young to imderstand

    The serious words he said

    Yet often now the good mans look

    Before me seems to swim
    As if some inward feeling took

    The outward guise of him

    As if in passions heated war
    Or near temptations charm

    Through him the lowvoiced monitor
    Forewarned me of the harm

    Stranger and pilgrim  from that day

    Of meeting first and last
    Wherever Dutys pathway lay

    His reverent steps have passed

    The poor to feed the lost to seek

    To proffer life to death
    Hope to the erring  to the weak

    The strength of his own faith

    To plead the captives right  remove
    The sting of hate from Law

    And soften in the fire of love
    The hardened steel of War

    He walked the dark world in the mild
    Still guidance of the Light

    In tearful tenderness a child
    A strong man in the right



    From what great perils on his way
    He found in prayer release

    Through what abysmal shadows lay
    His pathway unto peace

    God knoweth  we could only see
    The tranquil strength he gained

    The bondage lost in liberty
    The fear in love unfeigned

    And I  my youthful fancies grown

    The habit of the man
    Whose field of life by angels sown

    The wilding vines oerran

    Low bowed in silent gratitude

    My manhoods heart enjoys
    That reverence for the pure and good

    Which blessed the dreaming boys

    Still shines the light of holy lives

    Like starbeams over doubt
    Each sainted memory Christlike drives

    Some dark possession out

    O friend  O brother  not in vain

    Thy life so calm and true
    The silver dropping of the rain

    The fall of summer dew

    How many burdened hearts have prayed
    Their lives like thine might be

    But more shall pray henceforth for aid
    To lay them down like thee

    With weary hand yet steadfast will

    In old age as in youth
    Thy Master found thee sowing still

    The good seed of His truth

    As on thy taskfield closed the day

    In goldenskied decline
    His angel met thee on the way

    And lent his arm to thine

    Thy latest care for man  thy last
    Of earthly thought a prayer

    Oh who thy mantle backward cast
    Is worthy now to wear

    Methinks the mound which marks thy bed
    Might bless our land and save

    As rose of old to life the dead
    Who touched the prophets grave

    PERSONAL POEMS



    TO CHARLES SUMNER

    If I have seemed more prompt to censure

    wrong
    Than praise the right  if seldom to thine

    ear
    My voice hath mingled with the exultant

    cheer
    Borne upon all our Northern winds along
    If I have failed to join the fickle throng
    In wideeyed wonder that thou standest

    strong
    In victory surprised in thee to find
    Broughams scathing power with Cannings

    grace combined
    That he for whom the ninefold Muses

    sang
    From their twined arms a giant athlete

    sprang
    Barbing the arrows of his native tongue
    With the spent shafts Latonas archer

    flung
    To smite the Python of our land and

    time
    Fell as the monster born of Crissas slime
    Like the blind bard who in Castalian

    springs
    Tempered the steel that clove the crest of

    kings
    And on the shrine of Englands freedom

    laid
    The gifts of Cumse and of Delphis shade
    Small need hast thou of words of praise

    from me
    Thou knowest my heart dear friend and

    well canst guess
    That even though silent I have not the

    less
    Rejoiced to see thy actual life agree
    With the large future which I shaped for

    thee
    When years ago beside the summer sea
    White in the moon we saw the long waves

    fall
    Baffled and broken from the rocky wall
    That to the menace of the brawling flood
    Opposed alone its massive quietude
    Calm as a fate  with not a leaf nor vine
    Nor birchspray trembling in the still

    moonshine
    Crowning it like Gods peace I sometimes

    think
    That night  scene by the sea prophet
    ical



    For Nature speaks in symbols and in signs
    And through her pictures human fate

    divines
    That rock wherefrom we saw the billows

    sink
    In murmuring rout uprising clear and

    tall
    In the white light of heaven the type of

    one
    Who momently by Errors host assailed
    Stands strong as Truth in greaves of

    granite mailed
    And tranquilfronted listening over all
    The tumult hears the angels say Well

    done

    BURNS

    ON RECEIVING A SPRIG OF HEATHER IN
    BLOSSOM

    No more these simple flowers belong

    To Scottish maid and lover
    Sown in the common soil of song

    They bloom the wide work over

    In smiles and tears in sun and showers

    The minstrel and the heather
    The deathless singer and the flowers

    He sang of live together

    Wild heatherbells and Robert Burns

    The moorland flower and peasant
    How at their mention memory turns

    Her pages old and pleasant

    The gray sky wears again its gold

    And purple of adorning
    And manhoods noonday shadows hold

    The dews of boyhoods morning

    The dews that washed the dust and soil
    From ofi the wings of pleasure

    The sky that flecked the ground of toil
    With golden threads of leisure

    I call to mind the summer day

    The early harvest mowing
    The sky with sun and clouds at play

    And flowers with breezes blowing

    I hear the blackbird in the corn

    The locust in the haying
    And like the fabled hunters horn

    Old tunes my heart is playing



    BURNS



    197



    How oft that clay with fond delay

    I sought the maples shadow
    And sang with Burns the hours away

    Forgetful of the meadow

    Bees hummed birds twittered overhead

    I heard the squirrels leaping
    The good dog listened while I read

    And wagged his tail in keeping

    I watched him while in sportive mood
    I read  The Twa Dogs  story

    And half believed he understood
    The poets allegory

    Sweet day sweet songs  The golden hours
    Grew brighter for that singing

    From brook and bird and meadow flowers
    A dearer welcome bringing

    New light on homeseen Nature beamed

    New glory over Woman
    And daily life and duty seemed

    No longer poor and common

    I woke to find the simple truth

    Of fact and feeling better
    Thau all the dreams that held my youth

    A still repining debtor

    That Nature gives her handmaid Art
    The themes of sweet discoursing

    The tender idyls of the heart
    In every tongue rehearsing

    Why dream of lands of gold and pearl

    Of loving knight and lady
    When farmer boy and barefoot girl

    Were wandering there already

    I saw through all familiar things

    The romance underlying
    The joys and griefs that plume the wings

    Of Fancy skyward flying

    I saw the same blithe day return

    The same sweet fall of even
    That rose on wooded Craigieburn

    And sank on crystal Devon

    I matched with Scotlands heathery hills
    The sweetbrier and the clover

    With Ayr and Doon my native rills
    Their wood hynnis chanting over



    Oer rank and pomp as he had seen

    I saw the Man ujrising
    No longer common or unclean

    The child of Gods baptizing

    With clearer eyes I saw the worth

    Of life among the lowly
    The Bible at his Cotters hearth

    Had made my own more holy

    And if at times an evil strain

    To lawless love appealing
    Broke in upon the sweet refrain

    Of pure and healthful feeling

    It died upon the eye and ear

    No inward answer gaining
    No heart had I to see or hear

    The discord and the staining

    Let those who never erred forget
    His worth in vain bewailings

    Sweet Soul of Song  I own my debt
    Uncancelled by his failings

    Lament who will the ribald line
    Which tells his lapse from duty

    How kissed the maddening lips of wine
    Or wanton ones of beauty

    But think while falls that shade between

    The erring one and Heaven
    That he who loved like Magdalen

    Like her may be forgiven

    Not his the song whose thunderous chime

    Eternal echoes render
    The mournful Tuscans haunted rhyme

    And Miltons starry splendor

    But who his human heart has laid

    To Natures bosom nearer
    Who sweetened toil like him or paid

    To love a tribute dearer

    Through all his tuneful art how strong

    The human feeling gushes
    The very moonlight of his song

    Is warm with smiles and blushes

    Give lettered pomp to teeth of Time
    So  Bonnie Doon  but tarry

    Blot out the Epics stately rhyme
    But spare his Highland Mary

    PERSONAL POEMS



    TO GEORGE B CHEEVER

    So spake Esaias  so in words of flame
    Tekoas prophet  herdsinau smote with

    blame
    The traffickers in men and put to shame

    All earth and heaven before
    The sacerdotal robbers of the poor

    All the dread Scripture lives for thee again
    To smite like lightning on the hands profane
    Lifted to bless the slave whip and the chain

    Once more the old Hebrew tongue
    Bends with the shafts of God a bow new
    strung

    Take up the mantle which the prophets

    wore
    Warn with their warnings show the Christ

    once more
    Bound scourged and crucified in His

    blameless poor
    And shake above our land
    The unquenched bolts that blazed in Hoseas

    hand

    Not vainly shalt thou cast upon our years
    The solemn burdens of the Orieut seers
    And smite with truth a guilty nations ears

    Mightier was Luthers woid
    Than Seckingens mailed arm or Muttons
    sword



    TO JAMES T FIELDS

    ON A BLANK LEAF OF  POEMS PRINTED
    NOT published

    Well thought  who would not rather hear
    The songs to Love and Friendship sung
    Than those which move the strangers
    tongue

    And feed his imselected ear

    Our social joys are more than fame

    Life withers in the public look

    AVhy mount the pillory of a book
    Or barter comfort for a name

    Who in a house of glass would dwell
    With curious eyes at every pane
    To ring him in and out again

    Who wants the public criers bell



    To see the angel in ones way

    Who wants to play the asss part
    Bear on his back the wizard Art

    And in his service speak or bray

    And who his manly locks would shave
    And quench the eyes of common sense
    To share the noisy recompense

    That mocked the shorn and blinded slave

    The heart has needs beyond the head
    And starving in the plenitude
    Of strange gifts craves its common
    food

    Our human natures daily bread

    We are but men  no gods are we
    To sit in midheaven cold and bleak
    Each separate on his painful peak

    Thincloaked in selfcomplacency

    Better his lot whose axe is swung

    In Wartburgs woods or that poor girls
    Who by the Ilm her spindle whirls

    And sings the songs that Luther sung

    Than his who old and cold and vain
    At Weimar sat a demigod
    And bowed with Joves imperial nod

    His votaries in and out again

    Ply Vanity thy winged feet

    Ambition hew thy rocky stair

    Who envies him who feeds on air
    The icy splendor of his seat

    I see your Alps above me cut

    The dark cold sky  and dim and lone
    I see ye sitting  stone on stone

    With human senses dulled and shut

    I could not reach you if I would
    Nor sit among your cloudy shapes
    And spare the fable of the grapes

    And fox I would not if I could

    Keep to your lofty pedestals
    The safer plain below I choose
    Who never wins can rarely lose

    Who never climbs as rarely falls

    Let such as love the eagles scream
    Divide with him his home of ice
    For me shall gentler notes suffice

    The valleysong of bird and stream



    IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOSEPH STURGE



    199



    The pastoral bleat the drone of bees
    The flailbeat chiming far away
    The cattlelow at shut of day

    The voice of God in leaf and breeze

    Then lend thy hand my wiser friend
    And help me to the vales below
    In truth I have not far to go

    Where sweet with flowers the fields extend

    THE MEMORY OF BURNS

    Read at the Boston celebration of the him
    dredtli anniversary of the birth of Robert
    Burns 25th 1st mo 1859 In my absence
    these lines were read by Ralph Waldo Emerson

    How sweetly come the holy psalms

    From saints and martyrs down
    The waving of triumphal palms

    Above the thorny crown
    The choral praise the chanted prayers

    From harps by angels strung
    The hunted Camerons mountain airs

    The hymns that Luther sung

    Yet jarring not the heavenly notes

    The sounds of earth are heard
    As through the open minster floats

    The song of breeze and bird
    Not less the wonder of the sky

    That daisies bloom below
    The brook sings on though loud and high

    The cloudy organs blow

    And if the tender ear be jarred

    That haply hears by turns
    The saintly harp of Olneys bard

    The pastoral pipe of Burns
    No discord mars His perfect plan

    Who gave tliein both a tongue
    For he who sings the love of man

    The love of God hath sung

    Today be eveiy fault forgiven

    Of him in whom we joy
    We take with thanks the gold of Heaven

    And leave the earths alloy
    Be ours his music as of spring

    His sweetness as of flowers
    The songs the bard himself might sing

    In holier ears than ours

    Sweet airs of love and home the hum

    Of household melodies
    Come singing as the robins come



    To sing in dooryard trees
    And heart to heart two nations lean

    No rival wreaths to twine
    But blending in eternal green

    The holly and the pine



    IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOSEPH
    STURGE

    In the fair land oerwatched by Ischias
    mountains
    Across the charmed bay
    Whose blue waves keep with Capris silver
    fountains
    Perpetual holiday

    A king lies dead his wafer duly eaten
    His goldbought masses given

    And Romes great altar smokes with gums
    to sweeten
    Her foulest gift to Heaven

    And while all Naples thrills with mute
    thanksgiving
    The court of Englands queen
    For the dead monster so abhorred while
    living
    In mourning garb is seen

    With a true sorrow God rebukes that feign
    ing

    By lone Edgbastons side
    Stands a great city in the skys sad raining

    Bareheaded and weteyed

    Silent for once the restless hive of labor
    Save the low funeral tread

    Or voice of craftsman whispering to his
    neighbor
    The good deeds of the dead

    For him no minsters chant of the immor
    tals
    Rose from the lips of sin
    No mitred priest swung back the heavenly
    portals
    To let the white soul in

    But Age and Sickness framed their tearful
    faces
    In the low hovels door
    And prayers went up from all the dark by
    places
    And Ghettos of the poor

    PERSONAL POEMS



    The pallid toiler aud the negro chattel
    The vagrant of the street

    The human dice wherewith in games of
    battle
    The lords of earth compete

    Touched with a grief that needs no outward
    draping
    All swelled the long lament
    Of grateful hearts instead of marble
    shaping
    His viewless moimment

    For never yet with ritual pomp and splen
    dor
    In the long heretofore
    A heart more loyal warm and true and
    tender
    Has Englands turf closed oer

    And if there fell from out her grand old
    steeples
    No crash of brazen wail
    The murmurous woe of kindreds tongues
    and peoples
    Swept in on every gale

    It came from Holsteins birchenbelted
    meadows

    And from the tropic calms
    Of Indian islands in the sunsmit shadows

    Of Occidental palms

    From the locked roadsteads of the Bothnian
    peasants
    And harbors of the Finn
    Where wars worn victims saw his gentle
    presence
    Come sailing Christlike in

    To seek the lost to build the old waste
    places
    To link the hostile shores
    Of severing seas and sow with Englands
    daisies
    The moss of Finlands moors

    Thanks for the good mans beautiful ex
    ample

    Who in the vilest saw
    Some sacred crypt or altar of a temple

    Still vocal with Gods law

    And heard with tender ear the spirit sighing
    As from its prison cell



    Praying for pity like the mournful cry
    ing
    Of Jonah out of hell

    Not his the golden pens or lips persua
    sion
    But a fine sense of right
    And Truths directness meeting each occa
    sion
    Straight as a Ime of light

    His faith and works like streams that in
    termingle
    In the same channel ran
    The crystal clearness of an eye kept sin
    gle
    Shamed all the frauds of man

    The very gentlest of all human natures
    He joined to courage strong

    And love outreaching unto all Gods crea
    tures
    With sturdy hate of wrong

    Tender as woman manliness and meek
    ness
    In him were so allied
    That they who judged him by his strength
    or weakness
    Saw but a single side

    Men failed betrayed him but his zeal
    seemed nourished
    By failure and by fall
    Still a large faith in humankind he cher
    ished
    And in Gods love for all

    And now he rests  his greatness and his
    sweetness
    No more shall seem at strife
    And death has moulded into calm complete
    ness
    The statue of his life

    Where the dews glisten and the songbirds
    warble
    His dust to dust is laid
    In Natures keeping with no pomp of
    marble
    To shame his modest shade

    The forges glow the hammers all are ring
    ing
    Beneath its smoky veil



    NAPLES



    Hard by the city of his love is swinging
    Its clamorous iron flail

    But round his grave are quietude and beauty
    And the sweet heaven above

    The fitting symbols of a life of duty
    Transfigured into love



    BROWN OF OSSAWATOMIE

    John Brown of Ossawatomie spake on his

    dying day
    I will not have to shrive my soul a priest

    in Slaverys pay
    But let some poor slavemother whom I

    have striven to free
    With her children from the gallowsstair

    put up a prayer for me

    John Brown of Ossawatomie they led him

    out to die
    And lo  a poor slavemother with her little

    child pressed nigh
    Then the bold blue eye grew tender and

    the old harsh face grew mild
    As he stooped between the jeering ranks and

    kissed the negros child

    The shadows of his stormy life that moment
    fell apart

    And they who blamed the bloody hand for
    gave the loving heart

    That kiss from all its guilty means re
    deemed the good intent

    And round the grisly fighters hair the mar
    tyrs aureole bent

    Perish with him the folly that seeks through

    evil good
    Long live the generous purpose unstained

    with human blood
    Not the raid of midnight terror but the

    thought which underlies
    Not the borderers pride of daring but the

    Christians sacrifice

    Nevermore may yon Blue Ridges the North
    ern rifle hear

    Nor see the light of blazing homes flash on
    the negros spear

    But let the freewinged angel Truth their
    guarded passes scale

    To teach that right is more than might and
    justice more than mail



    So vainly shall Virginia set her battle in

    array
    In vain her trampling squadrons knead the

    winter snow with clay
    She may strike the pouncing eagle but she

    dares not harm the dove
    And every gate she bars to Hate shall open

    wide to Love



    NAPLES

    INSCRIBED TO ROBERT C WATERSTON
    OF BOSTON

    Helen Waterston died at Naples in her
    eighteenth year and lies buried in the Prot
    estant cemetery there The stone over her
    grave bears the lines

    Fold her O Father in Thine arms

    And let her henceforth be
    A messenger of love between

    Our human hearts and Thee

    I GIVE thee joy   I know to thee
    The dearest spot on earth must be
    Where sleeps thy loved one by the summer
    sea

    Where near her sweetest poets tomb
    The land of Virgil gave thee room
    To lay thy flower with her perpetual bloom

    I know that when the sky shut down
    Behind thee on tlie gleaming town
    On Baises baths and Posilippos crown

    And through thy tears the mocking

    Biirned Ischias mountain lines away
    And Capri melted in its sunny bay

    Through thy great farewell sorrow shot
    The sharp pang of a bitter thought
    That slaves must tread around that holy
    spot

    Thou knewest not the land was blest
    In giving thy beloved rest
    Holding the fond hope closer to her breast

    That every sweet and saintly grave
    Was freedoms prophecy and gave
    The pledge of Heaven to sanctify and
    save

    That pledge is answered To tliy ear
    The unchained city sends its cheer
    And tuned to joy the muffled bells of fear

    Ring Victor in The land sits free
    And happy by the summer sea
    And Bourbon Naples now is Italy

    She smiles above her broken chain
    Tlie languid smile that follows pain
    Stretching her cramped limbs to the sun
    again

    Oh joy for all who hear her call
    From gray Camaldolis conventwall
    And Elmos towers to freedoms carnival

    A new life breathes among her vines
    And olives like the breath of pines
    Blown downward from the breezy Apen
    nines

    Lean O my friend to meet that breath
    Rejoice as one who witnesseth
    Beauty from ashes rise and life from death

    Thy sorrow shall no more be pain
    Its tears shall fall in sunlit rain
    Writing the grave with flowers   Arisen
    again



    A MEMORIAL

    Moses Austin Cartland a dear friend and re
    lation who led a faithful life as a teacher and
    died iu the summer of 1863

    Oh thicker deeper darker growing

    The solemn vista to the tomb
    Must know henceforth another shadow

    And give another cypress room

    In love surpassing that of brothers

    We walked O friend from childhoods
    day

    And looking back oer fifty summers
    Our footprints track a common way

    One in our faith and one our longing
    To make the world within our reach

    Somewhat the better for our living
    And gladder for our human speech

    Thou heardst with me the farofp voices
    The old beguiling song of fame



    But life to thee was warm and present
    And love was better than a name

    To homely joys and loves and friendships
    Thy genial nature fondly clung

    And so the shadow on the dial

    Ran back and left thee always young

    And who could blame the generous weak
    ness

    Which only to thyself mijust
    So overprized the worth of others

    And dwarfed thy own with selfdistrust

    All hearts grew warmer in the presence
    Of one who seeking not his own

    Gave freely for the love of giving
    Nor reaped for self the harvest sown

    Thy greeting smile was pledge and prelude
    Of generous deeds and kindly words

    In thy large heart were fair guestchambers
    Open to sunrise and the birds

    The task was thine to mould and fashion
    Lifes plastic newness into grace

    To make the boyish heart heroic

    And light with thought the maidens
    face

    Oer all the land in town and prairie
    With bended heads of mourning stand

    The living forms that owe their beauty
    And fitness to thy shaping hand

    Thy call has come in ripened manhood
    The noonday calm of heart and mind

    While I who dreamed of thy remainmg
    To mourn me linger still behind

    Live on to own with selfupbraiding
    A debt of love still due from me

    The vain remembrance of occasions
    Forever lost of serving thee

    It was not mine among thy kindred
    To join the silent funeral prayers

    But all that long sad day of summer

    My tears of mourning dropped with
    theirs

    All day the seawaves sobbed with sorrow
    The birds forgot tlieir merry trills

    All day I heard the pines lamenting
    With thine upon thy homestead hills



    LINES ON A FLYLEAF

    Green be those hillside pines forever
    And green the meadowy lowlands be

    And green the old memorial beeches
    Nameearven iu the woods of Lee

    Still let them greet thy life companions
    Who thither turn their pilgrim feet

    Iu every mossy line recalling
    A tender memory sadly sweet

    O friend  if thought and sense avail not
    To kuow thee henceforth as thou art

    That all is well with thee forever
    I trust the instincts of my heart

    Thine be the quiet habitations

    Thine the green pastures blossomsowu
    And smiles of saintly recognition

    As sweet and tender as thy own

    Thou comst not from the hush and shadow
    To meet us but to thee we come

    With thee we never can be strangers
    And where thou art must still be home



    BRYANT ON HIS BIRTHDAY

    Mr Bryants seventieth birthday November
    3 1864 was celebrated by a festival to which
    these verses were seut

    We praise not now the poets art
    The rounded beauty of his song

    Who weighs him from his life apart
    Must do his nobler nature wrong

    Not for the eye familiar grown

    With charms to common sight denied
    The marvellous gift he shares alone

    ith him who walked on Rydalside

    Not for rapt hymn nor woodland lay
    Too grave for smiles too sweet for
    tears

    We speak his praise who wears today
    The glory of his seventy years

    When Peace brings Freedom in her train
    Let happy lips his songs rehearse

    His life is now his noblest strain
    His manhood better than his verse

    Thank God  his hand on Natures keys
    Its cunning keeps at lifes full span



    But dimmed and dwarfed iu times like
    these
    The poet seems beside the man

    So be it  let the garlands die

    The singers wreath the painters meed
    Let our names perish if thereby

    Our country may be saved and freed

    Mingle O bells along the Western slope

    And well might laugh her merriest laugh

    At broken spears in her behalf

    Yet spite of all the critics tell

    I frankly own I like her well

    It may be that she wields a pen

    Too sharply nibbed for thinskinned men

    That her keen arrows search and try

    The armor joints of dignity

    And though alone for error meant

    Sing through the air irreverent

    I blame her not the young athlete

    Who plants her womans tiny feet

    And dares the chances of debate

    Where bearded men might hesitate

    Who deeply earnest seeing well

    The ludicrous and laughable

    Mingling in eloquent excess

    Her anger and her tenderness

    And chiding with a halfcaress

    Strives less for her own sex than ours

    With principalities and powers

    And points us upward to the clear

    Sunned heights of her new atmosphere

    Heaven mend her faults   I will not pause

    To weigh and doubt and peck at flaws

    Or waste mj pity when some fool

    Provokes lier measureless ridicule

    Strongminded is she  Better so

    Than dulness set for sale or show

    A household folly capped and belled

    In fashions dance of puppets held

    Or poor pretence of womanhood

    Whose formal flavorless platitude

    Is warranted from all offence

    Of robust meanings violence

    Give me the wine of thought whose bead

    Sparkles along the page I read

    Electric words in which I find

    The tonic of the northwest wind

    The wisdom which itself allies

    To sweet and pure humanities

    Where scorn of meanness hate of wrong

    Are underlaid by love as strong

    The genial play of mirth that lights

    Grave themes of thought as when on nights

    Of summertime the harmless blaze

    Of thunderless heatlightning plays

    And tree and hilltop resting dim

    And doubtful on the skys vague rim

    Touched by that soft and lambent gleam

    Start sharply outlined from their dream

    Talk not to me of womans sphere
    Nor point with Scripture texts a sneer



    Nor wrong the manliest saint of all
    By doubt if he were here that Paul
    Would own the heroines who have lent
    Grace to truths stern arbitrament
    Foregone the praise to woman sweet
    And cast their crowns at Dutys feet
    Like her who by her strong Appeal
    Made Fashion weep and Mammon feel
    Who earliest summoned to withstand
    The colormadness of the land
    Counted her lifelong losses gain
    And made her own her sisters pain
    Or her who in her greenwood shade
    Heard the sharp call that Freedom made
    And answering struck from Sapphos lyre
    Of love the Tyrttean carmens fire
    Or that young girl  Domrdmys maid
    Revived a nobler cause to aid
    Shaking from warning fingertips
    The doom of her apocalypse
    Or her who worldwide entrance gave
    To the logcabin of the slave
    Made all his want and sorrow known
    And all earths languages his own

    No man rendered greater service to the

    great struggle between invading slaveholders
    and the free settlers of Kansas

    He has done the work of a true man
    Crown him honor him love him

    Weep over him tears of woman
    Stoop manliest brows above him

    O dusky mothers and daughters
    Vigils of mourning keep for him

    Up in the mountains and down by the
    waters
    Lift up your voices and weep for him

    For the warmest of hearts is frozen

    The freest of hands is still
    And the gap in our picked and chosen

    The long years may not fill

    No duty could overtask him

    No need his will outrun
    Or ever our lips could ask him

    His hands the work had done

    He forgot his own soul for others
    Himself to his neighbor lending

    He found the Lord in his suffering brothers
    And not in the clouds descending

    So the bed was sweet to die on

    Whence he saw the doors wide swung

    Against whose bolted iron

    The strength of his life was flung

    And he saw ere his eye was darkened
    The sheaves of the harvestbringing

    And knew while his ear yet hearkened
    The voice of the reapers singing

    Ah well  The world is discreet

    There are plenty to pause and wait
    But here was a man who set his feet

    Sometimes in advance of fate

    Plucked off the old bark when the inner

    Was slow to renew it
    And put to the Lords work the sinner

    When saints failed to do it

    Never rode to the wrongs redressing

    A worthier paladin
    Shall he not hear the blessing

    Good and faithful enter in

    With foam the slow waves gather and

    withdraw
    Beholdst the vision of the seer fulfilled
    And hearst the seawinds burdened with

    a sound
    Of falling chains as one by one un

    boiuid
    The nations lift their right hands up and

    And glad floats to thee oer thy summer

    On the salt wind that stirs thy whitening
    hair
    The song of freedoms bloodless victories
    Rejoice O Garibaldi  Though thy sword
    Failed at Romes gates and blood seemed

    vainly poured
    Where in Christs name the crowned infidel
    Of France wrought murder with the arms
    of hell
    On that sad mountain slope whose ghostly
    dead
    Unmindful of the gray exorcists ban
    Walk unappeased the chambered Vatican
    And draw the curtains of Napoleons bed
    Gods providence is not blind but full of

    eyes
    It searches all the refuges of lies
    And in His time and way the accursed
    things
    Before whose evil feet thy battlegage
    Has clashed defiance from hot youth to
    age
    Shall perish All men shall be priests and

    By love which is the law of liberty

    DARD

    Mrs Child wrote her lines beginning
    Again the trees are clothed in vernal green
    May 24 1859 on the first anniversary of Ellis
    Gray Lorings death but did not publish them
    for some years afterward when 1 first read
    them or I covild not have made the reference
    which I did to the extinction of slavery

    The sweet spring day is glad with music
    But through it sounds a sadder strain

    The worthiest of our narrowing circle
    Sings Lorings dirges oer again

    O woman greatly loved  I join thee
    In tender memories of our friend

    With thee across the awful spaces
    The greeting of a soul I send

    What cheer hath he  How Is it with him

    Where lingers he this weary Avhile
    Over what pleasant fields of Heaven

    Dawns the sweet sunrise of his smile

    Does he not know our feet are treading
    The earth hard down on Slaverys grave

    That in our crowning exultations

    We miss the charm his presence gave

    Why on this spring air comes no whisper
    From him to tell us all is well

    Why to our flowertime comes no token
    Of lily and of asphodel

    I feel the unutterable longing
    Thy hunger of the heart is mine

    I reach and grope for hands in darkness
    My ear grows sharp for voice or sign

    Still on the lips of all we question
    The finger of Gods silence lies

    Will the lost hands in ours be folded
    Will the shut eyelids ever rise

    O friend  no proof beyond this yearning
    This outreach of our hearts we need

    God will not mock the hope He giveth
    No love He prompts shall vainly plead

    Then let us stretch our hands in darkness
    And call our loved ones oer and oer

    Some day their arms shall close about us
    And the old voices speak once more

    No dreary splendors wait our coming
    Where rapt ghost sits from ghost apart

    Homeward we go to Heavens thanksgiving
    The harvestgathering of the heart



    THE SINGER

    This poem was written on the death of Alice
    Gary Her sister Phoebe heartbroken by her
    loss followed soon after Noble and richly
    gifted lovely in person and character they
    left behind them only friends and admirers

    Years since but names to me before
    Two sisters soiigbt at eve my door
    Two songbirds wandering from their nest
    A gray old farmhouse in the West

    How fresh of life the younger one
    Half smiles half tears like rain in sun



    Her gravest mood could scarce displace
    The dimples of her nutbrown face

    Wit sparkled on her lips not less
    For quick and tremulous tenderness
    And following close her merriest glance
    Dreamed through her eyes the hearts ro
    mance

    Timid and still the elder had
    Even then a smile too sweetly sad
    The crown of pain that all must wear
    Too early pressed her midnight hair

    Yet ere the summer eve grew long
    Her modest lips were sweet with song
    A memory haunted all her words
    Of cloverfields and singing birds

    Her dark dilating eyes expressed

    The broad horizons of the west

    Her speech dropped prairie flowers  the

    gold
    Of harvest wheat about her rolled

    Foredoomed to song she seemed to me

    I queried not with destiny

    I knew the trial and the need

    Yet all the more I said God speed

    What could I other than I did
    Could I a singingbiid forbid
    Deny the windstirred leaf  Rebuke
    The music of the forest brook

    She went with morning from my door
    But left me richer than before
    Thenceforth I knew her voice of cheer
    The welcome of her partial ear

    Years passed  through all the land her

    name
    A pleasant household word became
    All felt behind the singer stood
    A sweet and gracious womanhood

    Her life was earnest work not play
    Her tired feet climbed a weary way
    And even through her lightest strain
    We heard an undertone of pain

    Unseen of her her fair fame grew
    The good she did she rarely knew
    Unguessed of her in life the love
    That rained its tears her grave above



    HOW MARY GREW



    207



    When last I saw her full of peace
    She waited for her great release
    And that old friend so sage and bland
    Our later Franklin held her hand

    For all that patriot bosoms stirs
    Had moved that womans heart of hers
    And men who toiled in storm and sun
    Found her their meet companion

    Our converse from her suffering bed
    To healthful themes of life she led
    The outdoor world of bud and bloom
    And light and sweetness filled her room

    Yet evermore an underthought
    Of loss to come within us wrought
    And all the while we felt the strain
    Of the strong will that conquered pain

    God giveth quietness at last
    The common way that all have passed
    She went with mortal yearnings fond
    To fuller life and love beyond

    Fold the rapt soul in your embrace
    My dear ones  Give the singer place
    To you to her  I know not where
    I lift the silence of a prayer

    For only thus our own we find
    The gone before the left behind
    All mortal voices die between
    The unheard reaches the unseen

    Again the blackbirds sing  the streams
    Wake laughing from their winter dreams
    And tremble in the April showers
    The tassels of the maple flowers

    But not for her has spring renewed
    The sweet surprises of the wood
    And bird and flower are lost to her
    Who was their best interpreter

    What to shut eyes has God revealed
    What hear the ears that death has

    sealed
    What undreamed beauty passing show
    Requites the loss of all we know

    O silent land to which we move
    Enough if there alone be love



    And mortal need can neer outgrow
    What it is waiting to bestow

    O white soul  from that faroff shore
    Float some sweet song the waters oer
    Our faith confirm our fears dispel
    With the old voice we loved so well



    HOW MARY GREW

    These lines were in answer to an invitation
    to hear a lecture of Mary Grew of Philadelphia
    before the Boston Radical Club The reference
    in the last stanza is to an essay on iSappho by
    T W Higginson read at the club the preceding
    month

    With wisdom far beyond her years
    And graver than her wondering peers
    So strong so mild combining still
    The tender heart and queenly will
    To conscience and to duty true
    So up from childhood Mary Grew

    Then in her gracious womanhood
    She gave her days to doing good
    She dared the scornful laiigh of men
    The hounding mob the slanderers pen
    She did the work she found to do
    A Christian heroine Mary Grew

    The freed slave thanks her  blessing comes
    To her from womens weary homes
    The wronged and erring find in her
    Their censor mild and comforter
    The world were safe if but a few
    Could grow in grace as Mary Grew

    So New Years Eve I sit and say
    By this low woodfire ashen gray
    Just wishing as the night shuts down
    That I could hear in Boston town
    In pleasant Chestnut Avenue
    From her own lips how Mary Grew

    And hear her graceful hostess tell

    The silvervoiced oracle

    Who lately through her parlors spoke

    As through Dodonas sacred oak

    A wiser truth than any told

    By Sapphos lips of ruddy gold

    The way to make the world anew

    Is just to grow  as Mary Grew I

    And I obedient to thy will

    Have come a simple wreath to lay

    Superfluous on a grave that still

    Is sweet with all the flowers of May

    1 take with awe the task assigned

    It may be that my friend miglit miss
    In his new sphere of heart and mind
    Some token from my hand in this

    By many a tender memory moved
    Along the past my thought I send

    The record of the cause he loved
    Is the best record of its friend

    No trumpet sounded in his ear

    He saw not Sinais cloud and flame

    But never yet to Hebrew seer
    A clearer voice of duty came

    God said   Break thou these yokes
    undo

    These heavy burdens I ordain
    A work to last thy whole life through

    A ministry of strife and paiu

    Forego thy dreams of lettered ease
    Put thou the scholars promise by

    The rights of man are more than these
    He heard and answered   Here am I



    He set his face against the blast
    His feet against the flinty shard

    Till the hard service grew at last
    Its own exceeding great rewarct

    Lifted like Sauls above the crowd

    Uijon his kingly forehead fell
    The first sharp bolt of Slaverys cloud

    Launched at the truth he urged so well

    Ah  never yet at rack or stake

    Was sorer loss made Freedoms gain

    Than his who suffered for her sake
    The beaktorn Titans lingering pain

    The fixed star of his faith through all
    Loss doubt and peril shone the same

    As through a night of storm some tall
    Strong lighthouse lifts its steady flame

    Beyond the dust and smoke he saw

    The sheaves of Freedoms large increase

    The holy fanes of equal law
    The New Jerusalem of peace

    The weak might fear the worldling mock
    The faint and blind of heart regret

    All knew at last th eternal rock
    On which his forward feet were set

    The subtlest scheme of compromise
    Was folly to his purpose bold

    The strongest mesh of party lies
    Weak to the simplest truth he told

    One language held his heart and lip
    Straight onward to his goal he trod

    And proved the highest statesmanship
    Obedience to the voice of God

    No wail was in his voice  none heard
    When treasons stormcloud blackest
    grew

    The weakness of a doubtful word
    His duty and the end he knew

    The first to smite the first to spare

    When once the hostile ensigns fell
    He stretched out bauds of generous care

    To lift the foe he fought so well

    For there was nothing base or small
    Or craven in bis souls broad plan

    Forgiving all things personal
    He hated only wrong to man

    The old traditions of his State

    The memories of her great and good

    Took from his life a fresher date
    And in himself embodied stood

    How felt the greed of gold and place
    The venal crew that schemed and planned

    The fine scorn of that haughty face
    The spurning of that bribeless hand

    If than Romes tribunes statelier

    He wore his senatorial robe
    His lofty port was all for her

    The one dear spot on all the globe

    If to the masters plea he gave

    The vast contempt his manhood felt

    He saw a brother in the slave
    With man as equal man he dealt

    Proud was he  If his presence kept
    Its grandeur wheresoeer he trod

    As if from Plutarchs gallery stepped
    The hero and the demigod

    None failed at least to reach his ear
    Nor want nor woe appealed in vain

    The homesick soldier knew his cheer
    And blessed him from his ward of pain

    Safely his dearest friends may own
    The slight defects he never hid

    The surfaceblemish in the stone
    Of the tall stately pyramid

    Suffice it that he never brought
    His conscience to the public mart

    But lived himself the truth he taught
    White  souled cleanhanded pure of
    heart

    What if he felt the natural pride
    Of power in noble use too true

    With thin humilities to hide

    The work he did the lore he knew

    Was he not just  Was any wronged
    By that assured selfestimate

    He took but what to him belonged
    Unenvious of anothers state

    Well might he heed the words he spake
    And scan with care the written page

    Through which he still shall warm and wake
    The hearts of men from age to age



    Ah  who shall blame him now because
    He solaced thus his hours of pain

    Should not the oerworn thresher pause
    And hold to light his golden grain

    No sense of humor dropped its oil
    On the hard ways his purpose went

    Small play of fancy lightened toil
    He spake alone the thing he meant

    He loved his books the Art that hints
    A beauty veiled behind its own

    The gravers line the pencils tints
    The chisels shape evoked from stone

    He cherished void of selfish ends
    The social courtesies that bless

    And sweeten life and loved his friends
    With most unworldly tenderness

    But still his tired eyes rarely learned
    The glad relief by Nature brought

    Her mountain ranges never turned
    His current of persistent thought

    The sea rolled chorus to his speech

    Threebanked like Latiums tall trireme

    With laboring oars  the grove and beach
    Were Forum and the Academe

    The sensuous joy from all things fair
    His strenuous bent of soul repressed

    And left from youth to silvered hair
    Few hours for pleasure none for rest

    For all his life was poor without
    O Nature make the last amends

    Train all thy flowers his grave about
    And make thy singingbirds his friends

    Revive again thou summer rain
    The broken turf upon his bed

    Breathe summer wind thy tenderest
    strain
    Of low sweet music overhead

    With calm and beauty symbolize

    The peace which follows long annoy

    And lend our earthbent mourning eyes
    Some hint of his diviner joy

    For safe with right and truth he is
    As God lives he must live alway

    There is no end for souls like his
    No night for children of the day

    Nor cant nor poor solicitudes

    Made weak his lifes great argument
    Small leisure his for frames and moods

    Who followed Duty where she went

    The broad fair fields of God he saw
    Beyond the bigots narrow bound

    The truths he moulded into law
    In Christs beatitudes he found

    His statecraft was the Golden Rule
    His right of vote a sacred trust

    Clear over threat and ridicule

    All heard his challenge   Is it just

    And when the hour supreme had come
    Not for himself a thought he gave

    In that last pang of martyrdom

    His care was for the halffreed slave

    Not vainly dusky hands upbore

    In prayer the passing soul to heaven

    Whose mercy to His suffering poor
    Was service to the Master given

    Long shall the good States annals tell
    Her childrens children long be taught

    How praised or blamed he guarded
    well
    The trust he neither shunned nor sought

    If for one moment turned thy face
    O Mother from thy son not long

    He waited calmly in his place

    The sure remorse which follows wrong

    Forgiven be the State he loved

    The one brief lapse the single blot

    Forgotten be the stain removed
    Her righted record shows it not

    The lifted sword above her shield

    With jealous care shall guard his fame

    The pinetree on her ancient field

    To all the winds shall speak his name

    The marble image of her son

    Her loving hands shall yearly crown

    And from her pictured Pantheon
    His grand majestic face look down

    O State so passing rich before

    Who now shall doubt thy highest claim
    The world that counts thy jewels oer

    Shall longest pause at Sumners name

    Fate summoned in graybearded age to

    act
    A history stranger than his written fact
    Him who portrayed the splendor and the

    gloom
    Of that great hour when throne and altar

    fell
    With long deathgroan which still is audi
    ble
    He when around the walls of Paris

    rung
    The Prussian bugle like the blast of doom
    And every ill which follows unblest war
    Maddened all France from Finistre to

    Var
    The weight of fourscore from his

    shoulders flung
    And guided Freedom in the path he saw
    Lead out of chaos into light and law
    Peace not imperial but republican
    And order pledged to all the Rights of

    went
    When powers of evil like the smiting

    seas
    On Hollands dikes assailed her liberties
    Sadly while yet in doubtful balance hung
    The weal and woe of France the bells were

    rung
    For her lost leader Paralyzed of will
    Above his bier the hearts of men stood

    still
    Then as if set to his dead lips the horn
    Of Roland wound once more to rouse and

    warn
    The old voice filled the air  His last brave

    word
    Not vainly France to all her boundaries

    stirred
    Strong as in life he still for Freedom

    wrought
    As the dead Cid at red Toloso fought

    FITZGREENE HALLECK


    The echoes of his song




    Too late the tardy meed we bring


    AT THE UNVEILING OF HIS STATUE


    The praise delayed so long


    Among their graven shapes to whom


    Too late alas  Of all who knew


    Thy civic wreaths belong


    The living man today


    city of his love make room


    Before his unveiled face how few


    For one whose gift was song


    Make bare their locks of gray


    Not his the soldiers sword to wield


    Our lips of praise must soon be dumb


    Nor his the helm of state


    Our grateful eyes be dim


    Nor glory of the stricken field


    brothers of the days to come


    Nor triumph of debate


    Take tender charge of him


    In common ways with common men


    New hands the wires of song may sweep


    He served his race and time


    New voices challenge fame


    As well as if his clerkly pen


    But let no moss of years oercreep


    Had never danced to rhyme

    A duty left undone


    Oh well may Essex sit forlorn




    Beside her seablown shore


    He toiled and sang  and year by year


    Her well beloved her noblest born


    Men found their homes more sweet


    Is hers in life no more


    And through a tenderer atmosphere




    Looked down the brick walled street


    No lapse of years can render less




    Her memorys sacred claim


    The Greeks wild onset Wall Street


    No fountain of forgetfulness

    Can wet the lips of Fame


    The Red King walked Broadway




    And Alnwick Castles roses blew


    A grief alike to wound and heal


    From Palisades to Bay


    A thought to soothe and pain




    The sad sweet pride that mothers feel


    Fair City by the Sea  upraise


    To her must still remain


    His veil with reverent hands




    And mingle with thy own the praise


    Good men and true she has not lacked


    And pride of other lands


    And brave men yet shall be




    The perfect flower the crowning fact


    Let Greece his fiery lyric breathe


    Of all her years was he


    Above her herourns




    And Scotland with her hollj wreathe


    As Galahad pure as Merlin sage

    To grace in Arthurs golden age


    Oh stately stand thy palace walls


    The fabled Table Round


    Thy tall ships ride the seas




    Today thy poets name recalls


    A voice the battles trumpetnote


    A prouder thought than these


    To welcome and restore




    A hand that all unwilling smote


    Not less thy pulse of trade shall beat


    To heal and build once more


    Nor less thy tall fleets swim




    That shaded square and dusty street


    A soul of fire a tender heart

    Too warm for hate he knew

    The generous victors graceful part
    To sheathe the sword he drew

    When Earth as if on evil dreams

    Looks back upon her wars
    And the white light of Christ outstreams

    From the red disk of Mars

    His fame who led the stormy van

    Of battle well may cease
    But never that which crowns the man

    Whose victory was Peace

    Mourn Essex on thy seablown shore

    Thy beautiful and brave
    Whose failing hand the olive bore

    Whose dying lips forgave

    Let age lament the youthful chief

    And tender eyes be dim
    The tears are more of joy than grief

    That fall for one like him

    I

    And where now Bayard will thy foot
    steps tend
    My sister asked our guest one winters

    day
    Smiling he answered in the Friends sweet
    way
    Common to both   Wherever thou shalt

    send
    What wouldst thou have me see for thee
    She laughed
    Her dark eyes dancing in the woodfires
    glow
    Loffoden isles the Kilpis and the low
    Unsetting sun on Finmarks fishingcraft
    All these and more I soon shall see for
    thee
    He answered cheerily  and he kept his

    pledge
    On Lapland snows the North Capes
    windy wedge
    And Tromsi freezing in its winter sea
    He went and came But no man knows

    the track
    Of his last journey and he comes not
    back



    He brought us wonders of the new and
    old
    We shared all climes with him The

    Arabs tent
    To him its storytelling secret lent
    And pleased we listened to the tales he

    told
    His task beguiled with songs that shall en
    dure
    In manly honest thoroughness he

    wrought
    From humble homelays to the heights
    of thought
    Slowly he climbed but every step was

    sure
    How with the generous pride that friend
    ship hath
    We who so loved him saw at last the

    crown
    Of civic honor on his brows pressed down
    Rejoiced and knew not that the gift was
    death
    And now for him whose praise in deaf
    ened ears
    Two nations speak we answer but with

    Green as thy June turf keep his memory

    Let
    Nor wood nor dell nor storied stream
    forget
    Nor winds that blow round lonely Cedar
    croft
    Let the home voices greet him in the far
    Strange land that holds him  let the

    messages
    Of love pursue him oer the chartless
    seas
    And immapped vastness of his unknown

    star
    Loves language heard beyond the loud
    discomse
    Of perishable fame in every sphere
    Itself interprets  and its utterance here
    Somewhere in Gods unfolding universe
    Shall reach our traveller softening the

    OUR AUTOCRAT

    Read at the breakfast given in honor of Dr
    Hohnes by the publishers of the Atlantic
    Monthly December 3 1S7U

    His laurels fresh from song and lay
    Romance art science rich in all

    And young of heart how dare we say
    We keep his seventieth festival

    No sense is here of loss or lack

    Before his sweetness and his light
    The dial holds its shadow back

    The charmed hours delay their flight

    His still the keen analysis

    Of men and moods electric wit

    Free play of mirth and tenderness
    To heal the slightest wound from it

    And his the pathos touching all

    Lifes sins and sorrows and regrets

    Its hopes and fears its final call
    And rest beneath the violets

    His sparkling surface scarce betrays
    The thoughtful tide beneath it rolled

    The wisdom of the latter days
    And tender memories of the old

    What shapes and fancies grave or gay
    Before us at his bidding come

    The Treadmill tramp the OneHorse Shay
    The dumb despair of Elsies doom

    The tale of Avis and the Maid

    The plea for lips that cannot speak

    The holy kiss that Iris laid

    On Little Bostons pallid cheek

    Long may he live to sing for us

    His sweetest songs at evening time

    And like his Chambered Nautilus
    To holier heights of beauty climb

    Though now unnumbered guests surround
    The table that he rules at will

    Its Autocrat however crowned

    Is but our friend and comrade still

    The world may keep his honored name
    The wealth of all his varied powers

    A stronger claim has love tlian fame
    And he himself is only ours

    I have more fully expressed my admiration
    and regard for Lydia Maria Child in the bio
    graphical introduction which I wrote for the
    volimie of Letters published after her death

    We sat together last Mayday and talked
    Of the dear friends who walked

    Beside us sharers of the hopes and fears
    Of live and forty years

    Since first we met in Freedoms hope for
    lorn
    And heard her battlehorn
    Sound through the valleys of the sleeping
    North
    Calling her children forth

    And youth pressed forward with hope
    lighted eyes

    And age with forecast wise
    Of the long strife before the triumph won

    Girded his armor on

    Sadly as name by name we called the roll
    We heard the deadbells toll

    For the unanswering many and we knew
    The living were the few

    And we who waited our own call before

    The inevitable door
    Listened and looked as all have done to
    win

    Some token from within

    No sign we saw we heard no voices call

    The impenetrable wall
    Cast down its shadow like an awful doubt

    On all who sat without

    Of many a hint of life beyond the veil

    And many a ghostly tale
    Wherewith the ages spanned the gulf be
    tween

    The seen and the unseen

    Seeking from omen trance and dream to
    gain
    Solace to doubtfid pain
    And touch Avith groping hands the gar
    ment hem
    Of truth sufficing them

    We talked  and turning from the sore
    unrest

    Of an allbaffling quest
    We tliought of holy lives that from us passed

    Hopeful unto the last

    As if they saw beyond the river of death

    Like Him of Nazareth
    The many mansions of the Eternal days

    Lift up their gates of praise

    And hushed to silence by a reverent awe

    Methought O friend I saw
    In thy true life of word and work and
    thought

    The proof of all we sought

    Did we not witness in the life of thee

    Lnmortal prophecy
    And feel when with thee that thy footsteps
    trod

    An everlasting road

    Not for brief days thy generous sympathies

    Thy scorn of selfish ease
    Not for the poor prize of an earthly goal

    Thy strong uplift of soid

    Thau thine was never turned a fonder heart

    To nature and to art
    In fairformed Hellas in her golden prime

    Thy Philotheas time

    Yet loving beauty thou couldst pass it by

    And for the poor deny
    Thyself and see thy fresh sweet flower of
    fame

    Wither in blight and blame

    Sharing His love who holds in His embrace

    The lowliest of our race
    Sure the Divine economy must be

    Conservative of thee

    For truth must live with truth selfsacri
    fice

    Seek out its great allies
    Good must find good by gravitation sure

    And love with love endure

    And so since thou hast passed within the
    gate

    Whereby awhile I wait
    I give blind grief and blinder sense the lie

    Thou hast not lived to die



    IN MEMORY

    JAMES T FIELDS

    As a guest who may not stay
    Long and sad farewells to say
    Glides with smiling face away

    Of the sweetness and the zest
    Of thy happy life possessed
    Thou hast left us at thy best

    Warm of heart and clear of brain
    Of thy sunbright spirits wane
    Thou hast spared us all the pain

    Now that thou hast gone away
    What is left of one to say
    Who was open as the day

    What is there to gloss or shim
    Save with kindly voices none
    Speak thy name beneath the sun

    Safe thou art on every side
    Friendship nothing finds to hide
    Loves demand is satisfied

    Over manly strength and worth
    At thy desk of toil or hearth
    Played the lambent light of mirth

    Mirth that lit but never burned
    All thy blame to pity turned
    Hatred thou hadst never learned

    Every harsh and vexing thing
    At thy homefire lost its sting
    Where thou wast was always spring

    And thy perfect trust in good
    Faith in man and womanhood
    Chance and change and time withstood

    Small respect for cant and whine
    Bigots zeal and hate malign
    Had that sunny soul of thine

    But to thee was dutys claim
    Sacred and thy lips became
    Reverent with one holy Name

    Therefore on thy unknown way
    Go in Gods peace  Ae who stay
    But a little while delay

    Keep for us O friend whereer
    Thou art waiting all that here
    Made thy earthly presence dear

    Something of thy pleasant past
    On a ground of wonder cast
    In the stiller waters glassed

    Keep the human heart of thee
    Let the mortal only be
    Clothed in immortality

    And when fall our feet as fell

    Thine upon the asphodel

    Let thy old smile greet us well

    Proving in a world of bliss
    What we fondly dream in this
    Love is one with holiness

    tieth anniversary of the birthday of VicePres
    ident Wilson February 16 1882

    The lowliest born of all the land
    He WTung from Fates reluctant hand

    The gifts which happier boyhood claims
    And tasting on a thankless soil
    The bitter bread of unpaid toil

    He fed his soul with noble aims

    And Nature kindly provident
    To him the futures promise lent

    The powers that shape mans destinies
    Patience and faith and toil he knew
    The close horizon round him grew

    Broad with great possibilities

    By the low hearthfires fitful blaze
    He read of old heroic days

    The sages thought the patriots speech
    Unhelped alone himself he taught
    His school the craft at which he wrought

    His lore the book within his reach

    He felt his countrys need  he knew
    The work her children had to do

    And when at last he heard the call
    In her behalf to serve and dare
    Beside his senatorial chair

    He stood the unquestioned peer of
    aU



    Beyond the accident of birth

    He proved his simple manhoods worth

    Ancestral pride and classic grace
    Confessed the largebrained artisan
    So clear of sight so wise in plan

    And counsel equal to his place

    With glance intuitive he saw
    Through all disguise of form and law

    And read men like an open book
    Fearless and firm he never quailed
    Nor turned aside for threats nor failed

    To do the thing he undertook

    How wise how brave he was how well
    He bore himself let history tell

    While waves onr flag oer land and sea
    No black thread in its warp or weft
    He found dissevered States he left

    A grateful Nation strong and free



    THE POET AND THE CHILDREN

    LONGFELLOW

    With a glory of winter sunshine

    Over his locks of gray
    In the old historic mansion

    He sat on his last birthday

    With his books and his pleasant pictures
    And his household and his kin

    While a sound as of myriads singing
    From far and near stole in

    It came from his own fair city

    From the prairies boundless plain

    From the Golden Gate of sunset
    And the cedarn woods of Maine

    And his heart grew warm within him
    And his moistening eyes grew dim

    For he knew that his countrys children
    Were singing the songs of him

    The lays of his lifes glad morning
    The psalms of his evening time

    Whose echoes shall float forever
    On the winds of every clime

    All their beautiful consolations
    Sent forth like birds of cheer

    Came flocking back to his windows
    And sang in the Poets ear

    PERSONAL POEMS



    Grateful but solemn and tender


    For him whose voice for freedom


    The music rose and fell


    Swayed friend and foe at will


    With a joy akin to sadness


    Hushed is the tongue of silver


    And a greeting like farewell


    The golden lips are still


    With a sense of awe he listened


    For her whose life of duty


    To the voices sweet and young


    At scoff and menace smiled


    The last of earth and the first of heaven


    Brave as the wife of Roland


    Seemed in the songs they sung


    Yet gentle as a Child


    And waiting a little longer


    And for him the threehilled city


    For the wonderful change to come


    Shall hold in memory long


    He heard the Summoning Angel


    Whose name is the hint and token


    Who calls Gods children home


    Of the pleasant Fields of Song


    And to him in a holier welcome


    For the old friends unforgotten


    Was the mystical meaning given


    For the young thou hast not known


    Of the words of the blessed Master


    I speak their heartwarm greeting


    Of such is the kingdom of heaven


    Come back and take thy own




    From Englands royal farewells




    And honors fitly paid


    A WELCOME TO LOWELL


    Come back dear Russell Lowell




    To Elmwoods waiting shade


    Take our hands James Russell Lowell




    Our hearts are all thy own


    Come home with all the garlands


    Today we bid thee welcome


    That crown of right thy head


    Not for ourselves alone


    I speak for comrades living




    I speak for comrades dead


    In the long years of thy absence




    Some of us have grown old




    And some have passed the portals




    Of the Mystery untold

    Paused by his door to hear

    Magician  who from commonest elements


    For him our guide and Nestor


    Called up divine ideals clothed upon


    Who the march of song began


    By mystic lights soft blending into one


    The white locks of his ninety years


    Womanly grace and childlike innocence


    Bared to thy winds Cape Ann


    Teacher  thy lesson was not given in vain




    Beaut is goodness  ugliness is sin


    For hiin who to the music


    Arts place is sacred  nothing foul therein


    Her pines and hemlocks played


    May crawl or tread with bestial feet profane


    Set the old and tender story


    If rightly choosing is the painters test


    Of the lorn Acadian maid


    Thy choice master ever was the best

    EVA

    Suggested by Mrs Stowes tale of Uncle
    Tains Cabin and written wlien the characters
    in the tale were realities by the fiieside of
    countless American homes

    Dry the tears for holy Eva
    With the blessed angels leave her
    Of the form so soft and fair
    Give to earth the tender care

    For the golden locks of Eva
    Let the sunny southland give her
    Flowery pillow of repose
    Orangebloom and budding rose

    In the better home of Eva
    Let the shining ones receive her
    With the welcomevoiced psalm
    Harp of gold and waving palm

    All is light and peace with Eva
    There the darkness cometh never
    Tears are wiped and fetters fall
    And the Lord is all in all

    Weep no more for happy Eva
    Wrong and sin no more shall grieve her
    Care and pain and weariness
    Lost iu love so measureless

    Gentle Eva loving Eva
    Child confessor true believer
    Listener at the Masters knee
    Suffer such to come to me

    Oh for faith like thine sweet Eva
    Lighting all the solemn river
    And the blessings of the poor
    Wafting to the heavenly shore



    A LAY OF OLD TIME

    Written for the Essex County AgTicultural
    Fair and sung at the banquet at Newburyport
    October 2 1856



    One morning of the first sad Fall

    Poor Adam and his bride
    Sat in the shade of Edens wall

    But on the outer side

    She blushing in her figleaf suit

    For the chaste garb of old
    He sighing oer his bitter fruit

    For Edens drupes of gold

    Behind them smiling in the morn

    Their forfeit garden lay
    Before them wild with rock and thorn

    The desert stretched away

    They heard the air above them fanned

    A light step on the sward
    And lo  they saw before them stand

    The angel of the Lord

    Arise he said  why look behind

    When hope is all before
    And patient hand and willing mind

    Your loss may yet restore

    I leave with you a spell whose power

    Can make the desert glad
    And call around you frviit and flower

    As fair as Eden had

    I clothe your hands with power to lift
    The curse from off your soil

    Your very doom shall seem a gift
    Your loss a gain through Toil

    Go cheerfid as yon hummingbees

    To labor as to play
    White glimmering over Edens trees

    The angel passed away

    The pilgrims of the world went forth

    Obedient to the word
    And found whereer they tilled the earth

    A garden of the Lord



    218



    The thorntree cast its evil fruit
    And blushed with plum and pear



    KENOZA LAKE



    219



    And seeded grass and trodden root
    Grew sweet beneath their care

    We share our primal parents fate
    And in our turn and day

    Look back on Edens sworded gate
    As sad and lost as they

    But still for us his native skies
    The pitying Angel leaves

    And leads through Toil to Paradise
    New Adams and new Eves



    A SONG OF HARVEST

    For the Agricultural and Horticultural Exhi
    bition at Amesbury and Salisbury September

    28 1858

    This day two hundred 3ears ago
    The wild grape by the rivers side

    And tasteless groundnut trailing low
    The table of the woods supjjlied

    Unknown the apples red and gold
    Tlie blushing tint of peach and pear

    Tlie mirror of the Powow told
    No tale of orchards ripe and rare

    Wild as the fruits he scorned to till
    These vales the idle Indian trod

    Nor knew the glad creative skill
    The joy of him who toils with God

    O Painter of the fruits and flowers

    We thank Thee for thy wise design
    Whereby these human hands of ours

    In Natures garden work with Thine

    And thanks that from our daily need
    The joy of simple faith is born

    That he who smites the summer weed
    May trust Thee for the autumn corn

    Give fools their gold and knaves their
    power

    Let fortunes bubbles rise and fall
    Who sows a field or trains a flower

    Or plants a tree is more than all

    For he who blesses most is blest

    And God and man shall own his worth
    Who toils to leave as his bequest

    An added beauty to the earth



    And soon or late to all that sow
    Tlie time of harvest shall be given

    The flower shall bloom the fruit shall grow
    If not on earth at last in heaven



    KENOZA LAKE

    This beautiful lake in East Haverhill was the
    Great Pond  of the writers boyhood In
    18yj a movement was made for improving its
    shores as a public park At the opening of the
    park August ol 185i the poera which gave it
    the name of Kenoza in the Indian language
    signifying Pickerel was read

    As Adam did in Paradise

    Today the primal right we claim
    Fair mirror of the woods and skies

    We give to thee a name

    Lake of the pickerel   let no more
    The echoes answer back  Great Pond

    But sweet Kenoza from thy shore
    And watching hills beyond

    Let Indian ghosts if such there be
    Who ply unseen their shadowy lines

    Call back the ancient name to thee
    As with the voice of pines

    The shores we trod as barefoot boys

    The nutted woods we wandered through

    To friendship love and social joys
    We consecrate anew

    Here shall the tender song be sung
    And memorys dirges soft and low

    And wit shall sparkle on the tongue
    And mirth shall overflow

    Harmless as summer lightning plays
    From a low hidden cloud by night

    A light to set the hills ablaze
    But not a bolt to smite

    In sunny South and prairied West
    Are exiled hearts remembering still

    As bees their hive as birds their nest
    The homes of Haverhill

    They join us in our rites today

    And listening we may hear erelong
    From inland lake and ocean bay

    The echoes of our song



    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    Kenoza  oer no sweeter lake

    Shall morning break or nooncloud sail
    No fairer face than thine shall take

    The sunsets golden veil

    Long be it ere the tide of trade

    Shall break with harshresounding din

    The quiet of thy banks of shade
    And hills that fold thee in

    Still let thy woodlands hide the hare
    The shy loon sound his trumpetnote

    Windweary from his fields of air
    The wildgoose on thee float

    Thy peace rebuke our feverish stir
    Thy beauty our deforming strife

    Thy woods and waters minister
    The healing of their life

    And smless Mirth from care released
    Behold nnawed thy mirrored sky

    Smiling as smiled on Canas feast
    The Masters loving eye

    And when the summer day grows dim
    And light mists walk thy mimic sea

    Revive in us the thought of Him
    Who walked on Galilee



    FOR AN AUTUMN FESTIVAL

    The Persians flowery gifts the shrine
    Of fruitful Ceres charm no more

    The woven wreaths of oak and pine
    Are dust along the Isthmian shore

    But beauty hatli its homage still
    And nature holds us still in debt

    And womans grace and household skill
    And manhoods toil are honored yet

    And we today amidst our flowers
    And fruits have come to own again

    The blessings of the summer hours
    The early and the latter rain

    To see our Fathers liand once more
    Reverse for us the plenteous horn

    Of autumn filled and running oer

    With fruit and flower and golden corn

    Once more the liberal year laughs out
    Oer richer stores than gems or gold



    Once more with harvestsong and shout
    Is Natures bloodless triumph told

    Our common mother rests and sings

    Like Ruth among her garnered sheaves

    Her lap is full of goodly things

    Her brow is bright with autumn leaves

    Oh favors every year made new

    Oh gifts with rain and sunshine sent
    The bounty overruns our due

    The fulness shames our discontent

    We shut our eyes the flowers bloom on

    We murmur but the cornears fill
    We choose the shadow but the sun

    That casts it shines behind us still

    God gives us with our rugged soil
    The power to make it Edenfair

    And richer fruits to crown our toil
    Than summerwedded islands bear

    Who murmurs at his lot today

    Who scorns his native fruit and bloom
    Or sighs for dainties far away

    Beside the bounteous board of home

    Thank Heaven instead that Freedoms arm
    Can change a rocky soil to gold

    That brave and generous lives can warm
    A clime with northern ices cold

    And let these altars wreathed with flowers
    And piled with fruits awake again

    Thanksgivings for the golden hours
    The early and the latter rain



    THE QUAKER ALUMNI

    Read at the Friends School Anniversary
    Providence R I 0th mo ISOO

    From the wellsprings of Hudson the sea
    cliffs of Maine

    Grave men sober matrons you gather
    again

    And with hearts warmer grown as your
    heads grow more cool

    Play over the old game of going to school

    All your strifes and vexations your whims

    and complaints
    You were not saints yourselves if the

    children of saints



    THE QUAKER ALUMNI



    All your petty selfseekings and rivalries

    doue
    Round the dear Alma Mater your hearts

    beat as one

    How widely soeer you have strayed from

    the fold
    Though your  thee  has grown  you and

    your drab blue and gold
    To the old friendly speech and the garbs

    sober form
    Like the heart of Argyle to the tartan you

    warm

    But the first greetings over you glance

    round the hall
    Your hearts call the roll but they answer

    not all
    Through the turf green above them the dead

    cannot hear
    Name by name in the silence falls sad as

    a tear

    In love let us trust they were summoned

    so soon
    From the morning of life while we toil

    through its noon
    They were frail like ourselves they had

    needs like our own
    And they rest as we rest in Gods mercy

    alone

    Unchanged by our changes of spirit and

    frame
    Past now and henceforward the Lord is

    the same
    Tliough we sink in the darkness His arms

    break our fall
    And in death as in life He is Father of

    all

    We are older  our footsteps so light in

    the play
    Of the faraway schooltime move slower

    today
    Here a beard touched with frost there a

    bald shining crown
    And beneath the caps border gray mingles

    with brown

    But faith should be cheerful and trust

    should be glad
    And our follies and sins not our years make

    us sad



    Should the heart closer shut as the bonnet

    grows prim
    And the face grow in length as the hat grows

    in brim

    Life is brief duty grave  but witli rain
    folded vdngs

    Of yesterdays sunshine the grateful heart
    sings

    And we of all others have reason to pay

    The tribute of thanks and rejoice on our
    way

    For the counsels that turned from the follies
    of youth

    For the beauty of patience the whiteness of

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    Who scofPs at our birthright   the words

    of the seers
    And the songs of the bards in the twilight

    of years
    All the f oregleams of wisdom in santon and

    sage
    In prophet and priest are our true heritage

    The Word which the reason of Plato dis
    cerned

    The truth as whose symbol the Mithrafire
    burned

    The soul of the world which the Stoic but
    gviessed

    In the Light Universal the Quaker con
    fessed

    No honors of war to our worthies be
    long

    Their plain stem of life never flowered into
    song

    But the fountains they opened still gush by
    the way

    And the world for their healing is better to
    day

    He who lies where the minsters groined

    arches curve down
    To the tombcrowded transept of Englands

    renown
    The glorious essayist by genius enthroned
    Whose pen as a sceptre the Muses all

    owned

    Who through the worlds pantheon walked

    in his pride
    Setting new statues up thrusting old ones

    aside
    And in fiction the pencils of history dipped
    To gild oer or blacken each saint in his

    crypt

    How vainly he labored to sully with

    blame
    The white bust of Penn in the niche of his

    fame
    Self  will is self  wounding perversity

    blind
    On himself fell the stain for the Quaker

    designed

    For the sake of his truehearted father be
    fore him

    For the sake of the dear Quaker mother
    that bore him



    For the sake of his gifts and the works that

    outlive him
    And his brave words for freedom we freely

    forgive him

    There are those who take note that our
    numbers are small

    New Gibbous vho write our decline and our
    fall

    But the Lord of the seedfield takes care of
    His own

    And the world shall yet reap what our sow
    ers have sown

    The last of the sect to his fathers may go

    Leaving only his coat for some Barnuna to
    show

    But the truth will outlive him and broaden
    with years

    Till the false dies away and the wrong dis
    appears

    Nothing fails of its end Out of sight

    sinks the stone
    In the deep sea of time but the circles

    sweep on
    Till the lowrippled murmurs along the

    shores run
    And the dark and dead waters leap glad in

    the sun

    Meanwhile shall we learn in our ease to

    forget
    To the martyrs of Truth and of Freedom

    our debt
    Hide their words out of sight like the garb

    that they wore
    And for Barclays Apology offer one more

    Shall we fawn round the priestcraft that
    glutted the shears

    And festooned the stocks with our grand
    fathers ears

    Talk of Woolmans unsoundness  count
    Penn heterodox

    And take Cotton Mather in place of George
    Fox

    Make our preachers warchaplains  quote

    Scripture to take
    The hunted slave back for Onesinnis sake
    Go to burning churchcandles and chanting

    in choir
    And on the old meetinghouse stick up a

    spire



    THE QUAKER ALUMNI



    No  the old paths we 11 keep until better Three shades at this moment seem walking

    are shown lier strand

    Credit good where we find it abroad or our Each with head halocrowned and with

    palms in his hand
    Wise Berkeley grave Hopkins and smiling
    serene



    own
    And while  Lo here and  Lo there  the

    multitude call
    Be true to ourselves and do justice to all



    The good round about us we need not refuse
    Nor talk of our Zion as if we were Jews
    But why shiik the badge which our fathers

    have worn
    Or beg the worlds pardon for having been

    born

    We need not pray over the Pharisees prayer
    Nor claim that our visdom is Benjamins

    share
    Truth to us and to others is equal and one
    Shall we bottle the free air or hoard up the



    Well know we our birthright may serve

    but to show
    How the meanest of weeds in the richest

    soil grow
    But we need not disparage the good which

    we hold
    Though the vessels be earthen the treasure

    is gold

    Enough and too much of the sect and the

    name
    What matters our label so truth be our

    aim
    The creed may be wrong but the life may

    be true
    And hearts beat the same under drab coats

    or blue

    So the man be a man let him worship at

    will
    In Jerusalems coiirts or on Gerizims hill
    When she makes up her jewels what cares

    yon good town
    For the Baptist of Wayland the Quaker of

    Brown

    And this green favored island so fresh and
    seablown

    When she counts up the worthies her annals
    have known

    Never waits for the pitiful gangers of sect

    To measure her love and mete out her re
    spect



    On prelate and puritan Channing is seen

    One holy name bearing no longer they
    a need

    Credentials of party and passwords of

    creed
    The new song they sing hath a threefold

    accord
    And they own one baptism one faith and

    one Lord

    But the golden sands run out  occasions

    like these
    Glide swift into shadow like sails on the

    seas
    While we sport with tlie mosses and pebbles

    ashore
    They lessen and fade and we see them no

    more

    Forgive me dear friends if my vagrant

    thoughts seem
    Like a schoolboys who idles and plays with

    his theme
    Forgive the light measure whose changes

    display
    The sunshine and rain of our brief April

    day

    There are moments in life when the lip and

    the eye
    Try the question of whether to smile or to

    cry
    And scenes and reunions that prompt like

    our own
    The tender in feeling the playful in tone

    I who never sat down with the boys and the
    girls

    At the feet of your Slocuras and Cartlands
    and Earles

    By courtesy only permitted to lay

    On your festivals altar my poor gift to
    day

    I would joy in your joy  let me have a

    friends part
    In the warmth of your welcome of hand

    and of heart

    OUR RIVER
    t

    FOR A SUMMER FESTIVAL AT THE
    LAURELS  ON THE MERRIMAC

    Jean Pierre Brissot the famous leader of the
    Girondist party in the French Revolution when
    a young man travelled extensively in the United
    States He visited the valley of the Merriniae
    and speaks in terms of admiration of the view
    from Moultons hill opposite Amesbviry The
    Laurel Party so called was composed of
    ladies and gentlemen in the lower valley of the
    Merrimac and invited friends and guests in
    other sections of the country Its thoroughly
    enjoyable annual festivals were held in the early
    summer on the pineshaded laurelblossomed



    slopes of the Newbury side of the river opposite
    Pleasant Valley in Araesbury The several
    poems called out by these gatherings are here
    printed in sequence

    Once more on yonder laurelled height

    The summer flowers have budded
    Once more with summers golden light

    The vales of home are flooded
    And once more by the grace of Him

    Of every good the Giver
    We sing upon its wooded rim

    The praises of our river

    Its pines above its waves below

    The westwind down it blowing
    As fair as when the young Brissot

    Beheld it seaward flowing
    And bore its memory oer the deep

    To soothe the martyrs sadness
    And fresco in his troubled sleep

    His prison walls with gladness

    We know the world is rich with streams

    Renowned in song and story
    Whose music murmurs through our dreams

    Of human love and glory
    We know that Arnos banks are fair

    And Rhine has castled shadows
    And poettuned the Doon and Ayr

    Go singing down their meadows

    But while unpictured and unsung

    By painter or by poet
    Our river waits the tuneful tongue

    And cunning hand to show it
    We only know the fond skies lean

    Above it warm with blessing
    And the sweet soul of onr Undine

    Awakes to our caressing

    No fickle sun god holds the flocks

    That graze its shores in keeping
    No icy kiss of Dian mocks

    The youth beside it sleeping
    Onr Christian river loveth most

    The beautiful and human
    The heathen streams of Naiads boast

    But ours of man and woman

    The miner in his cabin hears

    The ripple we are hearing
    It whispers soft to homesick ears

    Around the settlers clearing
    In Sacramentos vales of corn



    REVISITED



    225



    Or Santees bloom of cotton
    Our river by its villeyborn
    Was never yet forgotten

    The drum rolls loud the bugle fills

    The summer air with clangor
    The warstorm shakes the solid hills

    Beneath its tread of anger
    Young eyes that last year smiled in ours

    Now point the rifles barrel
    And hands then stained with fruits and
    flowers

    Bear redder stains of quarrel

    But blue skies smile and flowers bloom on

    And rivers still keep flowing
    The dear God still his rain and sun

    On good and ill bestowing
    His pinetrees whisjjer  Trust and wait

    His flowers are prophesying
    That all we dread of change or fate

    His love is underlying

    And thou O Mountainborn   no more

    We ask the wise AUotter
    Than for the firmness of thy shore

    The calmness of thy water
    The cheerful lights that overlay

    Thy rugged slopes with beauty
    To match our spirits to our day

    And make a joy of duty



    REVISITED

    Read at  The Laurels on the Merrimac
    6th month 1865

    The roll of drums and the bugles wailing
    Vex the air of our vales no more

    The spear is beaten to hooks of pruning
    The sliare is the sword the soldier wore

    Sing soft sing low our lowland river
    Under thy banks of laurel bloom

    Softly and sweet as the hour bcseemeth
    Sing us the songs of peace and home

    Let all the tenderer voices of nature

    Temper the triumph and chasten mirth

    Full of the infinite love and pity

    For fallen martyr and darkened hearth

    But to Him who gives us beauty for ashes
    And the oil of joy for mourning long



    Let thy hills give thanks and all thy waters
    Break into jubilant waves of song

    Bring us the airs of hills and forests
    The sweet aroma of birch and pine

    Give us a waft of the northwind laden
    With sweetbrier odors and breath of kine

    Bring us the purple of mountain sunsets
    Shadows of clouds that rake the hills

    The green repose of thy Plymouth meadows
    The gleam and ripple of Campton rills

    Lead us away in shadow and sunshine
    Slaves of fancy through all thy miles

    The winding ways of Femigewasset
    And Winnipesaukees hundred isles

    Shatter in sunshine over thy ledges

    Laugh in thy plunges from fall to fall

    Play with thy fringes of elms and darken
    Under the shade of the mountain wall

    Tlie cradlesong of thy hillside fountains
    Here in thy glory and strength repeat

    Give us a taste of thy upland music
    Show us the dance of thy silver feet

    Into thy dutiful life of uses

    Pour the music and weave the flowers
    With the song of birds and bloom of mead
    ows

    Lighten and gladden thy heart and ours

    Sing on  bring down O lowland river

    The joy of the hills to the waiting sea
    The wealth of the vales the pomp of moun
    tains
    The breath of the woodlands bear with
    thee

    Here in the calm of thy seaward valley
    Mirth and labor shall hold their truce

    Dance of water and mill of grinding
    Both are beauty and both are use

    Type of the Northlands strength and glory
    Pride and hope of our home and race

    Freedom lending to rugged labor
    Tints of beauty and lines of grace

    Once again O beautiful river

    Hear our greetings and take our thanks
    Hither we come as Eastern pilgrims

    Throng to the Jordans sacred banlcs

    For though by the Masters feet untrod
    den
    Though never His word has stilled thy
    waves
    Well for us may thy shores be holy

    With Christian altars and saintly graves

    THE LAURELS
    At the twentieth and last anniversary

    From these wild rocks I look today
    Oer leagues of dancing waves and see

    The far low coastline stretch away
    To where our river meets the sea

    The light wind blowing off the land
    Is burdened with old voices  through

    Shut eyes I see how lip and hand
    The greeting of old days renew

    friends whose hearts still keep their

    prime
    Whose bright example warms and cheers
    Ye teach us how to smile at Time
    And set to music all his years

    1 thank you for sweet summer days
    For pleasant memories lingering long

    For joyful meetings fond delays
    And ties of friendship woven strong

    As for the last time side by side
    You tread the paths familiar grown

    I reach across the severing tide

    And blend my fare wells with your own

    Make room O river of our home

    For other feet in place of ours
    And in the summers yet to come

    Make glad another Feast of Flowers

    Hold in thy mirror calm and deep
    The pleasant pictures thou hast seen

    Forget thy lovers not but keep

    Our memory like thy laurels green



    JUNE ON THE MERRIMAC

    O DWELLERS in the stately towns

    What come ye out to see
    This common earth this common sky

    This water flowing free

    As gayly as these kalmia flowers
    Your dooryard blossoms spring

    As sweetly as these wildwood birds
    Your caged minstrels sing

    You find but common bloom and green

    The rippling rivers rune
    The beauty which is everywhere

    Beneath the skies of June

    The Hawkswood oaks the storm torn
    plumes

    Of old pineforest kings
    Beneath whose centurywoven shade

    Deer Islands mistress sings

    And here are pictured Artichoke

    And Cursons bowery mill
    And Pleasant Valley smiles between

    The river and the hill

    You know full well these banks of bloom

    The uplands wavy line
    And how tlie sunshine tips with fire

    The needles of the pine

    Yet like some old remembered psalm

    Or sweet familiar face
    Not less because of commonness

    You love the day and place

    And not in vain in this soft air
    Shall hardstiung nerves relax

    Not all in vain the oerworu brain
    Forego its daily tax

    The lust of power the greed of gain

    Have all the year their own
    The haunting demons well may let

    Our one bright day alone

    Unheeded let the newsboy call
    Aside the ledger lay

    The world will keep its treadmill step
    Though we fall out today



    HYMN



    227



    The truants of lifes weary school

    Witliout excuse from thrift
    We change for once the gains of toil

    For Gods unpurchased gift

    From ceiled rooms from silent books
    From crowded car and town

    Dear Mother Earth upon thy lap
    We lay our tired heads down

    Cool summer wind our heated brows

    Blue river through the green
    Of clustering pines refresh the eyes

    Which all too much have seen

    For us these pleasant woodland ways
    Are thronged with memories old

    Have felt the grasp of friendly hands
    And heard loves story told

    A sacred presence overbroods
    The earth whereon we meet

    These winding forestpaths are trod
    By more than mortal feet

    Old friends called from us by the voice
    Which they alone could hear

    From mystery to mystery
    From life to life draw near

    More closely for the sake of them
    Each others hands we press

    Our voices take from them a tone
    Of deeper tenderness

    Our joy is theirs their trust is ours

    Alike below above
    Or here or there about us fold

    The arms of one great love

    We ask today no countersign

    No party names we own
    Unlabelled individual

    We bring ourselves alone

    What cares the unconventioned wood
    For jjasswords of the town

    The sound of fashions shibboleth
    The laughing waters drown

    Here cant forgets his dreary tone

    And care his face forlorn
    The liberal air and sunshine laugh

    The bigots zeal to scorn



    From manhoods weary shoulder falls

    His load of selfish cares
    And woman takes her rights as flowers

    And brooks and birds take theirs

    The license of the happy woods

    The brooks release are ours
    The freedom of the unsliamed wind

    Among the gladeyed flowers

    Ye here no evil thought finds place

    Nor foot profane comes in
    Our grove like that of Samothrace

    Is set apart from sin

    We walk on holy ground  above

    A sky more holy smiles
    The chant of the beatitudes

    Swells down these leafy aisles

    Thanks to the gracious Providence
    That brings us here once more

    For memories of the good behind
    And hopes of good before

    And if unknown to us sweet days

    Of June like this must come
    Unseen of us these laurels clothe

    The riverbanks with bloom

    And these green paths must soon be trod

    By other feet than ours
    Full long may annual pilgrims come

    To keep the Feast of Flowers

    The matron be a girl once more

    The bearded man a boy
    And we in heavens eternal June

    Be glad for earthly joy

    kings HOUSE OF WORSHIP 1 864

    The poetic and patriotic preacher who had
    won fame in the East went to California in
    1860 and became a power on the Pacific coast
    It was not long after the opening of the house
    of worship built for him that he died

    Amidst these glorious works of Thine

    And dare not ask Thy hand to stay

    But through the warcloud pray to Thee
    For union but a union free
    With peace that comes of purity

    That Thou wilt bare Thy arm to save
    And smiting through this Red Sea wave
    Make broad a pathway for the slave

    For us confessing all our need

    We trust nor rite nor word nor deed

    Nor yet the broken staff of creed

    Assured alone that Thou art good
    To each as to the multitude
    Eternal Love and Fatherhood

    Weak sinful blind to Thee we kneel
    Stretch dumbly forth our hands and

    feel
    Our weakness is our strong appeal

    So by these Western gates of Even
    We wait to see with Thy forgiven
    The opening Golden Gate of Heaven

    Suffice it now In time to be
    Shall holier altars rise to Thee
    Thy Church our broad humanity

    White flowers of love its walls shall

    climb
    Soft bells of peace shall ring its chime
    Its days shall all be holy time

    A sweeter song shall then be heard
    The music of the worlds accord
    Confessmg Christ the Inward Word



    That song shall swell from shore to shore
    One hope one faith one love restore
    The seamless robe that Jesus wore



    HYMN

    FOR THE HOUSE OF WORSHIP AT GEORGE
    TOWN ERECTED IN MEMORY OF A
    MOTHER

    The giver of the house was the late George
    Peabody of London

    Thou dwellest not O Lord of all

    In temples which thy children raise
    Our work to Thine is mean and small

    And brief to Thy eternal days

    Forgive the weakness and the pride
    If marred thereby our gift may be

    For love at least has sanctified
    The altar that we rear to thee

    The heart and not the liand has wrought
    From sunken base to tower above

    The image of a tender thought
    The memory of a deathless love

    And though should never sound of speech

    Or organ echo from its wall
    Its stones would pious lessons teach

    Its shade in benedictions fall

    Here should the dove of peace be found
    And blessings and not curses given

    Nor strife profane nor hatred wound
    The mingled loves of earth and heaven

    Thou who didst soothe with dying breath
    The dear one watching by Thy cross

    Forgetful of the pains of death
    In sorrow for her mighty loss

    In memory of that tender claim
    O Motherborn the offering take

    And make it worthy of Thy name
    And bless it for a mothers sake



    A SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATION

    Read at the Presidents Levee Brown Uni
    versity 2Jth 6th month 1870



    A SPIRITUAL MANIFESTATION



    229



    Today the plant by Williams set

    Its summer bloom discloses
    The wilding sweetbrier of his prayers

    Is cxowned with cultured roses

    Once more the Island State repeats

    The lesson that he taught her
    And binds his pearl of charity

    Upon her brownlocked daughter

    Is t fancy that he watches still

    His Providence plantations
    That still the careful Founder takes

    A part on these occasions

    Methinks I see that reverend form
    Which all of us so well know

    He rises up to speak  he jogs
    The presidential elbow

    Good friends he says  you reap a field

    I sowed in selfdenial
    For toleration had its griefs

    And charity its trial

    Great grace as saith Sir Thomas More

    To him must needs be given
    Who heareth heresy and leaves

    The heretic to Heaven

    I hear again the snuffled tones

    I see in dreary vision
    Dyspeptic dreamers spiritual bores

    And prophets with a mission

    Each zealot thrust before my eyes

    His Scripturegarbled label
    All creeds were shouted in my ears

    As with the tongues of Babel

    Scourged at one carttail each denied

    The hope of every other
    Each martyr shook his branded fist

    At the conscience of his brother I

    How cleft the drearj drone of man

    The shriller pipe of woman
    As Gorton led his saints elect

    Who held all things in common

    Their gay robes trailed in ditch and
    swamp

    And torn by thorn and thicket
    The dancinggirls of Merry Mount

    Came dragging to my wicket



    Shrill Anabaptists shorn of ears

    Gray witchwives hobbling slowly
    And Antinomians free of law

    Whose very sins were holy

    Hoarse ranters crazed Fifth Monarch
    ists
    Of stripes and bondage braggarts
    Pale Churchmen with singed rubrics
    snatched
    From Puritanic fagots

    And last not least the Quakers came
    With tongues still sore from burning

    The Bay States dust from off their feet
    Before my threshold spurning

    A motley host the Lords debris
    Faiths odds and ends together

    Well might I shrink from guests with
    lungs
    Tough as their breeches leather

    If when the hangman at their heels
    Came rope in hand to catch them

    I took the hunted outcasts in
    I never sent to fetch them

    I fed but spared them not a whit

    I gave to all who walked in
    Not clams and succotash alone

    But stronger meat of doctrine

    I proved the prophets false I pricked

    The bubble of perfection
    And clapped upon their inner light

    The snuffers of election

    And looking backward on my times

    This credit I am taking
    I kept each sectarys dish apart

    No spiritual chowder making

    niere now the blending signs of sect

    Would puzzle their assorter
    The dryshod Quaker kept the land

    The Baptist held the water

    A common coat now serves for both

    The hat s no more a fixture
    And which was wet and which was dry

    Who knows in such a mixture

    Well  He who fashioned Peters dream
    To bless them all is able

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    And bird and beast and creeping thing
    Make clean upon His table

    I walked by my own light  but when

    The ways of faith divided
    Was I to force unwilling feet

    To tread the path that I did

    I touched the garmenthem of truth
    Yet saw not all its splendor

    I knew enough of doubt to feel
    For every conscience tender

    God left men free of choice as when
    His Edentrees were planted

    Because they chose amiss should I
    Deny the gift He granted

    So with a common sense of need
    Our common weakness feeling

    I left them with myself to God
    And His allgracious dealing

    I kept His plan whose rain and sun
    To tare and wheat are given

    And if the ways to hell were free
    I left them free to heaven

    Take heart with us O man of old
    Soulfreedoms brave confessor

    So love of God and man wax strong
    Let sect and creed be lesser

    The jarring discords of thy day
    In ours one hymn are swelling

    The wandering feet the severed paths
    All seek our Fathers dwelling

    And slowly learns the world the truth
    Tliat makes us all thy debtor

    That holy life is more than rite
    And spirit more than letter

    That they who differ polewide serve
    Perchance the common Master

    And other sheep He hath than they
    Who graze one narrow pasture

    For truths worst foe is he who claims

    To act as Gods avenger
    And deems beyond his sentrybeat

    The crystal walls in danger

    Who sets for heresy his traps
    Of verbal quuk and quibble



    And weeds the garden of the Lord
    With Satans borrowed dibble

    Today our hearts like organ keys
    One Masters touch are feeling

    The branches of a common Vine
    Have only leaves of healing

    Coworkers yet from varied fields
    We share this restful nooning

    The Quaker with the Baptist here
    Believes in close communing

    Forgive dear saint the playful tone
    Too light for thy deserving

    Thanks for thy generous faitli in man
    Thy trust in God unswerving

    Still echo in the hearts of men
    The words that thou hast sjioken

    No forge of hell can weld again
    The fetters thou hast broken

    The pilgrim needs a pass no more

    From Roman or Genevan
    Thoughtfree no ghostly tollman keeps

    Henceforth the road to Heaven



    CHICAGO

    The great fire at Chicago was on 810 Octo
    ber 1871

    Men said at vespers   All is well
    In one wild night the city fell
    Fell shrines of prayer and marts of gain
    Before the fiery hurricane

    On threescore spires had sunset shone
    Where ghastly sunrise looked on none
    Men clasped each others hands and said
    The City of the West is dead

    Brave hearts who fought in slow retreat
    The fiends of fire from street to street
    Turned powerless to tlie blinding glare
    The dumb defiance of despair

    A sudden impulse thrilled each wire
    That signalled round that sea of fire
    Swift words of cheer warm heart  throbs

    came
    In tears of pity died the flame



    THE GOLDEN WEDDING OF LONGWOOD



    231



    From East from West from South and

    North
    The messages of hope shot forth
    And underneath the severing wave
    The workl fullhanded reached to save

    Fair seemed the old  but fairer still
    The new the dreary void shall fill
    With dearer homes than those oerthrown
    For love shall lay each cornerstone

    Rise stricken city  from thee throw
    The ashen sackcloth of thy woe
    And build as to Amphions strain
    To songs of cheer thy walls again

    How shrivelled in thy hot distress
    The primal sin of selfishness
    How instant rose to take thy part
    The angel in the human heart

    Ah  not in vain the flames that tossed
    Above thy dreadful holocaust
    The Christ again has preached tlirough thee
    The Gospel of Humanity

    Then lift once more thy towers on high
    And fret with spires the western sky
    To tell that God is yet with us
    And love is still miraculous



    KINSMAN

    Died at the Island of Panay Philippine
    group aged nineteen years

    Where ceaseless Spring her garland twines
    As sweetly shall the loved one rest

    As if beneath the whispering pines
    And maple shadows of the West

    Ye mourn O hearts of home  for him
    But haply mourn ye not alone

    For him shall faroff eyes be dim
    And pity speak in tongues unknown

    There needs no graven line to give
    The story of his blameless youth

    All hearts shall throb intuitive

    And nature guess the simple truth

    The very meaning of his name
    Shall many a tender tribute win

    The stranger own his sacred claim
    And all the world shall be his kin



    And there as here on main and isle
    The dews of holy peace shall fall

    The same sweet heavens above him smile
    And Gods dear love be over all



    THE GOLDEN WEDDING OF
    LONGWOOD



    Longwood not far from Bayard Taylors
    birthplace in Kenuett Square Pennsylvania
    was the home of my esteemed friends John and
    Hannah Cox whose golden wedding was cele
    brated in 1874

    With fifty years between you and your

    wellkept wedding vow
    The Golden Age old friends of mine is not

    a fable now

    And sweet as has lifes vintage been through

    all your pleasant past
    Still as at Canas marriagefeast the best

    wine is the last

    Again before me with your names fair
    Chesters landscape comes

    Its meadows woods and ample barns and
    quaint stonebuilded homes

    The smoothshorn vales the wheaten slopes
    the boscage green and soft

    Of which their poet sings so well from
    towered Cedarcroft

    And lo  from all the country  side come

    neighbors kith and kin
    From city hamlet farm  house old the

    wedding guests come in

    And they who without scrip or purse mob
    hunted travelworn

    In Freedoms age of martyrs came as
    victors now return

    Older and slower yet the same files in the

    long array
    And hearts aie light and eyes are glad

    though heads are badgergray

    The firetried men of Thirtyeight who saw

    with me the fall
    Midst roaring flames and shouting mob of

    Pennsylvania Hall

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    Aiid tliey of Lancaster who turned the

    cheeks of tyrants pale
    Singing of freedom through the grates of

    Moyamensing jail

    And haply with them all unseen old com
    rades gone before

    Pass silently as shadows pass within your
    open door

    The eagle face of Liudley Coates brave
    Garretts daring zeal

    The Christian grace of Peunock the stead
    fast heart of Neal

    Ah me  beyond all power to name the

    worthies tried and true
    Grave men fair women youth and maid

    pass by in hushed review

    Of varying faiths a common cause fused

    all their hearts in one
    God give them now whateer their names

    the peace of duty done

    How gladly would I tread again the old
    remembered places

    Sit down beside your hearth once more and
    look in the dear old faces

    And thank you for the lessons your fifty

    years are teaching
    For honest lives that louder speak than

    half our noisy preaching

    For your steady faith and courage in that

    dark and evil time
    When the Golden Rule was treason and to

    feed the hungry crime

    For the poor slaves house of refuge when
    the hounds were on his track

    And saint and sinner church and state
    joined hands to send him back

    Blessings upon you   What you did for

    each sad suffering one
    So homeless faint and naked unto our

    Loid was done

    Fair fall on Konnetts pleasant vales and

    Longwoods bowery ways
    The mellow sunset of your lives friends of

    my early days



    May many more of quiet years be added to

    your sum
    And late at last in tenderest love the

    beckoning angel come

    Dear hearts are here dear hearts are there

    alike below above
    Our friends are now in either world and

    love is sure of love



    HYMN

    FOR THE OPENING OF PLYMOUTH CHURCH
    ST PAUL MINNESOTA

    All things are Thine  no gift have we
    Lord of all gifts to offer Thee
    And hence with gratefid hearts today
    Thy own before Thy feet we lay

    Tliy will was in the builders thought
    Thy hand unseen amidst us wrought
    Through mortal motive scheme and plan
    Thy wise eternal purpose ran

    No lack Thy perfect fulness knew
    For human needs and longings grew
    This house of prayer this home of rest
    In the fair garden of the West

    In weakness and in want we call

    On Thee for whom the heavens are small

    Thy glory is Thj childrens good

    Thy joy Thy tender Fatherhood

    O Father  deign these walls to bless
    Fill with Thy love their emptiness
    And let their door a gateway be
    To lead us from ourselves to Thee

    No Berserk thirst of blood had they
    No battle joy was theirs who set
    Against the alien bayonet

    Their homespun breasts in that old day

    Their feet had trodden peaceful ways

    They loved not strife they dreaded
    jiain



    I WAS A STRANGER AND YE TOOK ME IN

    They saw not what to us is plain
    That God would make mans wrath His
    praise

    No seers were they but simple men
    Its vast results the future hid
    The meaning of the work they did

    Was strange and daik and doubtful then

    Swift as their summons came they left

    The plough mid  furrow standing

    still
    The half  ground corn grist in the
    mill
    The spade in earth the axe in cleft

    They went where duty seemed to call

    They scarcely asked the reason why
    They onl knew they could but die

    And death was not the worst of all

    Of man for man the sacrifice

    All that was theirs to give they

    gave
    The flowers that blossomed from their
    grave
    Have sown themselves beneath all skies

    Their deathshot shook the feudal tower
    And shattered slaverys chain as

    well
    On the skys dome as on a bell

    Its echo struck the worlds great hour

    That fateful echo is not dumb

    The nations listening to its sound
    Wait from a centurys vantagegromid

    The holier triumphs yet to come

    The bridal time of Law and Love

    The gladness of tlie worlds release
    When warsick at the feet of Peace

    The hawk shall nestle with the dove

    The golden age of brotherhood
    Unknown to other rivalries
    Than of the mild humanities

    And gracious interchange of good

    When closer strand shall lean to strand
    Till meet beneath saluting flags
    The eagle of our mountaincrags

    The lion of our Motherland



    THE LIBRARY

    Sung at the opening of the Haverhill Library
    November 11 1875

    Let there be light   God spake of old
    And over chaos dark and cold
    And through the dead and formless frame
    Of nature life and order came

    Faint was the light at first that shone
    On giant fern and mastodon
    On halfformed plant and beast of prey
    And man as rude and wild as they

    Age after age like waves oerran
    The earth uplifting brute and man
    And mind at length in symbols dark
    Its meanings traced on stone and bark

    On leaf of palm on sedge wrought roll
    On plastic clay and leathern scroll
    Man wrote his thoughts  the ages passed
    And lo  the Press was found at last

    Then dead souls woke  the thoughts of men
    Whose bones were dust revived again
    The cloisters silence found a tongue
    Old prophets spake old poets sung

    And here today the dead look down
    The kings of mind again we crown
    We hear the voices lost so long
    The sages word the sibyls song

    Here Greek and Roman find themselves
    Alive along these crowded slielves
    And Sliakespeare treads again his stage
    And Chaucer paints anew his age

    As if some Pantheons marbles broke
    Their stony trance and lived and spoke
    Life thrills along the alcoved hall
    The lords of thought await oui call

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    And warm and soft the Gulf wind blew
    Through orange bloom and groves of
    palm

    A stranger from the frozen North

    Who sought the fount of health in vain

    Sank homeless on the alien earth

    And breathed the languid air with pain

    Gods angel came  The tender shade
    Of pity made her blue eye dim

    Against her womans breast she laid
    The drooping fainting head of him

    She bore him to a pleasant roomj

    Flowersweet and cool with salt sea air

    And watched beside his bed for whom
    His faroff sisters might not care

    She fanned his feverish brow and smoothed
    Its lines of pain with tenderest touch

    With holy hymn and prayer she soothed
    The trembling soul that feared so much

    Through her the peace that passeth sight
    Came to him as he lapsed away

    As one whose troubled clreams of night
    Slide slowly into tranquil day

    The sweetness of the Land of Flowers
    Upon his lonely grave she laid

    The jasmine dropped its golden showers
    The orange lent its bloom and sliade

    And something whispered in her thought
    More sweet than mortal voices be

    The service thou for him hast wrought
    O daughter  hath been done for me

    Our fathers God  from out whose hand
    The centuries fall like grains of sand
    We meet today united free
    And loyal to our land and Thee
    To thank Thee for the era done
    And trust Thee for the opening one



    Here where of old by Thy design
    The fathers spake that word of Thine
    Whose echo is the glad refrain
    Of rended bolt and falling chain
    To grace our festal time from all
    The zones of earth our guests we call



    Ill



    Be with us while the New World greets
    The Old World thronging all its streets
    Unveiling all the triumphs won
    By art or toil beneath tlie sun
    And unto common good ordain
    This rivalship of hand and brain



    Thou who hast here in concord furled
    The war flags of a gathered world
    Beneath our Western skies fulfil
    The Orients mission of goodwill
    And freighted with loves Golden Fleece
    Send back its Argonauts of peace



    For art and labor met in truce
    For beauty made the bride of use
    We thank Thee  but withal we crave
    The austere virtues strong to save
    The honor proof to place or gold
    The manhood never bought nor sold



    Oh make Thou us through centuries long
    In peace secure in justice strong
    Around our gift of freedom draw
    The safeguards of thy righteous law
    And cast in some diviner mould
    Let the new cycle shame the old

    The teacher and the scholar trust
    Their parting feet to separate ways



    HYMN OF THE CHILDREN



    235



    They part  but in the years to be

    Shall pleasant memories cling to each

    As shells bear inland from the sea
    The murmur of the rhythmic beach

    One knew the joy the sculptor knows
    When plastic to his lightest touch

    His claywrought model slowly grows
    To that fine grace desired so much

    So daily grew before her eyes

    The living shapes whereon she wrought
    Strong tender innocently wise

    The childs heart with the womans
    thought

    And one shall never quite forget

    The voice that called from dream and
    play

    The firm but kindly hand that set

    Her feet in learnings pleasant way

    The joy of Undine soulpossessed

    The wakening sense the strange de
    light

    That swelled the fabled statues breast
    And filled its clouded eyes with sight

    Youth and Beauty loved of all

    Ye pass from girlhoods gate of dreams
    In broader ways your footsteps fall

    Ye test the truth of all that seems

    Her little realm the teacher leaves
    She breaks her wand of power apart

    While for your love and trust she gives
    The warm thanks of a grateful heart

    Hers is the sober summer noon

    Contrasted with your morn of spring

    The waning with the waxing moon
    The folded with the outspread vnng

    Across the distance of the years

    She sends her Godspeed back to you

    She has no thought of doubts or fears
    Be but yourselves be pure be true



    heed the deep

    through the



    And prompt in duty

    Low voice of conscience
    ill

    And discord round about you keep
    YcMir faith in human nature still



    Be gentle  unto griefs and needs

    Be pitiful as woman should
    And spite of all the lies of creeds

    Hold fast the truth that God is good

    Give and receive  go forth and bless
    The world that needs the hand and
    heart

    Of Marthas helpful carefulness
    No less than Marys better part

    So shall the stream of time flow by
    And leave each year a richer good

    And matron loveliness outvie

    The nameless charm of maidenhood

    And when the world shall link your
    names
    With gracious lives and manners fine
    The teacher shall assert her claims

    And proudly whisper These were
    mine



    HYMN OF THE CHILDREN

    Sung at the anniversary of the Childrens
    Mission Boston 1878

    Thine are all the gifts O God

    Thine the broken bread
    Let the naked feet be shod

    And the starving fed

    Let Thy children by Thy grace

    Give as they abound
    Till the poor have breathingspace

    And the lost are found

    Wiser than the misers hoards

    Is the givers choice
    Sweeter than the song of birds

    Is the thankful voice

    Welcome smiles on faces sad

    As the flowers of spring
    Let the tender hearts be glad

    With the joy they bring

    Happier for their pitys sake
    Make their sports and plays

    And from lips of childhood take
    Thy perfected praise

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    THE LANDMARKS

    This poem was read at a meeting of citizens
    of Boston having for its object the preservation
    of the Old youth Church famous in Colonial
    and Revolutionary history



    Through the streets of Marblehead
    Fast the redwinged terror sped

    Blasting withering on it came
    With its hundred tongues of flame

    Where St Michaels on its way
    Stood like chained Andromeda

    Waiting on the rock like her
    Swift doom or deliverer

    Church that after seamoss grew
    Over walls no longer new

    Counted generations five
    Four entombed and one alive

    Heard the martial thousand tread
    Battleward from Marblehead

    Saw within the rockwalled bay
    Trevilles lilied pennons play

    And the fishers dory met
    By the barge of Lafayette

    Telling good news in advance
    Of the coming fleet of France

    Church to reverend memories dear
    Quaint in desk and chandelier

    Bell whose centuryrnsted tongue
    Burials tolled and bridals rung

    Loft whose tiny organ kept

    Keys that Snetzlers hand had swept

    Altar oer whose tablet old
    Sinais law its thunders rolled

    Suddenly the sharp cry came
    Look  St Michaels is aflame



    Round the low tower wall the fire
    Snakelike wound its coil of ire

    Sacred in its gray respect
    From the jealousies of sect

    Save it seemed the thought of all
    Save it though our rooftrees fall

    Up the tower the young men sprung
    One the bravest outward swung

    By the rope whose kindling strands
    Smoked beneath the holders hands

    Smiting down with strokes of power
    Burning fragments from the tower

    Then the gazing crowd beneath
    Broke the painful pause of breath

    Brave men cheered from street to street
    With homes ashes at their feet

    Houseless women kerchiefs waved

    Thank the Lord  St Michaels saved



    In the heart of Boston town
    Stands the church of old renown

    From whose walls the impulse went
    Which set free a continent

    From whose pulpits oracle
    Prophecies of freedom fell

    And whose steeplerocking din
    Rang the nations birthday in

    Standing at this very hour
    Perilled like St Michaels tower

    Held not in the clasp of flame
    But by mammons grasping claim

    Shall it be of Boston said

    She is shamed by Marblehead

    City of our pride  as there
    Hast thou none to do and dare

    Life was risked for Michaels shrine
    Shall not wealth be staked for thine



    A GREETING



    237



    Woe to thee when men shall search
    Vainly for the Old South Church

    When from Xeck to Boston Stone
    All thy pride of place is gone

    When from Bay and railroad car
    Stretched before them wide and far

    Men shall only see a great
    Wilderness of brick and slate

    Every holy spot oerlaid

    By the commonplace of trade

    City of our love  to thee
    Duty is but destiny

    True to all thy record saith
    Keep with thy traditions faith

    Ere occasion s overpast
    Hold its flowing forelock fast

    Honor still the precedents
    Of a grand munificence

    In thy old historic way
    Give as thou didst yesterday

    At the Southlands call or on
    Needs demand from fired St John

    Set thy Churchs muffled bell
    Free the generous deed to tell

    Let thy loyal hearts rejoice
    In the glad sonorous voice

    Ringing from the brazen mouth
    Of the bell of the Old South

    Ringing clearly with a will

    What she was is Boston still



    GARDEN

    A hymn for the American Horticultural So
    ciety 1882 Orifinally written to be simg at
    an agricultural and horticnltnral fair in Ames
    bury in lS  It was translated into Portu
    guese by Dom Pedro Emperor of Brazil and
    read at a liarest festival It has been trans
    lated into Italian also and sung by peasants at
    the gathering of the vintage



    O Painter of the fruits and flowers

    We own Thy wise design
    Whereby these human hands of ours

    May share the work of Thine

    Apart from Thee we plant in vain

    The root and sow the seed
    Thy early and Thy later rain

    Thy sun and dew we need

    Our toil is sweet with thankfulness

    Our burden is our boon
    The curse of Earths gray morning is

    The blessing of its noon

    Why search the wide world everywhere
    For Edens unknown ground

    That garden of the primal pair
    May nevermore be found

    But blest by Thee our patient toil

    May right the ancient wrong
    Aiid give to every clime and soil

    The beauty lost so long

    Our homestead flowers and fruited trees

    May Edens orchard shame
    We taste the tempting sweets of these

    Like Eve without her blame

    And North and South and East and West

    The pride of every zone
    The fairest rarest and the best

    May all be made our own

    Its earliest shrines the young world sought

    In hillgroves and in bowers
    The fittest offerings thither brought

    Were Thy own fruits and flowers

    And still with reverent hands we cull
    Thy gifts each year renewed

    The good is always beautiful
    The beautiful is good

    OCCASIONAL POEMS



    To her who in oiir evil time
    Dragged into light the nations crime
    With strength beyond the strength of men
    And mightier than their swords her pen
    To her who worldwide entrance gave
    To the logcabin of the slave
    Made all his wrongs and sorrows known
    And all earths languages his own
    North South and East and West made

    all
    The common air electrical
    Until the oercharged bolts of heaven
    Blazed down and every chain was riven

    Welcome from each and all to her
    Whose Wooing of the Minister
    Revealed the warm heart of the man
    Beneath the creedbomid Puritan
    And taught the kinship of the love
    Of man below and God above
    To her whose vigorous pencilstrokes
    Sketched into life her Oldtown Folks
    Whose fireside stories grave or gay
    In qnaint Sam Law sons vagrant way
    With old New Englands flavor rife
    Waifs from her rude idyllic life
    Are racy as the legends old
    By Chaucer or Boccaccio told
    To her who keeps through change of place
    And time her native strength and grace
    Alike where warm Sorrento smiles
    Or where by birchenshaded isles
    Whose summer winds have shivered oer
    The icy drift of Labrador
    She lifts to light the priceless Pearl
    Of Harpswells angelbeckoned girl
    To her at threescore years and ten
    Be tributes of the tongue and pen
    Be honor praise and heartthanks given
    The loves of earth the hopes of heaven

    Ah dearer than the praise that stirs
    The air today our love is hers
    She needs no guaranty of fame
    Whose own is linked with Freedoms name
    Long ages after ours shall keep
    Her memory living while we sleep
    The waves that wash our gray coast lines
    The winds that rock the Southern pines
    Shall sing of her  the unending years
    Shall tell her tale in unborn eais
    And when with sins and follies past
    Are numbered colorhate and caste
    White black and red shall own as one
    The noblest work by woman done



    GODSPEED

    Written on the occasion of a voyage made
    by my friends Amiie Fields and Sarah Orne
    Jewett

    Outbound your bark awaits you Were
    I one
    Whose prayer availeth much my vish

    should be
    Your favoring tradewind and consenting
    sea
    By sail or steed was never love outrun
    And here or there love follows her in
    whom
    All graces and sweet charities imite
    The old Greek beauty set in holier light
    And her for whom New Englands byways

    bloom
    Who walks among us welcome as the
    Spring
    Calling up blossoms where her light feet

    stray
    God keep you both make beautiful your
    way
    Comfort console and bless  and safely

    bring
    Ere yet I make upon a vaster sea
    The unreturning voyage my friends to
    me



    WINTER ROSES

    In reply to a flower gift from Mrs Putnams
    school at Jamaica Plain

    My garden roses long ago

    Have perished from the leaf strewn
    walks
    Tlieir pale fair sisters smile no more

    Upon the sweetbrier stalks

    Gone with the flowertime of my life
    Springs violets summers blooming
    pride

    And Natures winter and my own
    Stand flowerless side by side

    So might I yesterday have sung

    Today in bleak Decembers noon
    Come sweetest fragrance shapes and
    hues

    The rosy wealth of June

    Bless the young hands that culled the gift
    And bless the hearts that prompted it

    If undeserved it comes at least
    It seems not all unfit

    Of old my Quaker ancestors

    Had gifts of forty stripes save one

    Today as many roses crown
    The gray head of their son

    And with them to my fancys eye
    The freshfaced givexs smiling come

    And nine and thirty happy girls
    Make glad a lonely room

    They bring the atmosphere of youth

    The light and warmth of long ago
    Are in my heart and on my cheek

    The airs of morning blow

    O buds of girlhood yet unblown
    And fairer than the gift ye chose

    For you may years like leaves unfold
    The heart of Sharons rose



    THE REUNION

    Read September 10 1SS5 to the surviving
    students of Haverhill Academy in 18271830

    The gulf of seven and fifty years

    We stretch our welcoming hands across
    The distance but a pebbles toss

    Between us and our youth appears

    For in lifes school we linger on
    The remnant of a once full list
    Conning our lessons midismissed

    With faces to the setting sun

    And some have gone the unknown way
    And some await the call to rest
    Wlio knoweth whether it is best

    For those who went or those who stay

    And yet despite of loss and ill

    If faith and love and hope remain
    Our length of days is not in vain

    And life is well worth living still

    Still to a gracious Providence

    The thanks of gratefid hearts are due
    For blessings when our lives were new

    For all the good vouchsafed us since



    The pain that spared us sorer hurt
    The wish denied the purpose crossed
    And pleasiues fond occasions lost

    Were mercies to our small desert

    T is something that we wander back
    Gray pilgrims to our ancient ways
    And tender memories of old days

    Walk with us hj the Merrimac

    That even in lifes afternoon

    A sense of youth comes back again
    As through this cool September rain

    The still green woodlands dream of June

    The eyes grown dim to present things
    Have keener sight for bygone years
    And sweet and clear in deafening ears

    The bird that sang at morning sings

    Dear comrades scattered wide and far
    Send from their homes their kindly word
    And dearer ones unseen unheard

    Smile on us from some heavenly star

    For life and death with God aie one
    Unchanged by seeming change His care
    And love are round us here and there

    He breaks no thread His hand has spun

    Soul touches soul the muster roll

    Of life eternal has no gaps

    And after half a centurys lapse
    Our schoolday ranks are closed and whole

    Hail and farewell  We go our way

    Where shadows end we trust in light

    The star that ushers in the night
    Is herald also of the day

    1886

    The land that from the rule of kings
    In freeing us itself made free

    Our Old World Sister to us brings
    Her sculptured Dream of Liberty

    Unlike the shapes on Egypts sands
    Uplifted by the toilworn slave

    On Freedoms soil with freemens hands
    We rear the symbol free hands gave

    O France the beautiful  to thee
    Once more a debt of love we owe

    In peace beneath thy Colors Tbree

    Thy light and hope to all who sit

    In chains and darkness  Belt the earth
    With watchfires from thy torch up
    lit

    Reveal the primal mandate still

    Which Chaos heard and ceased to be

    Trace on midair th Eternal Will

    In signs of fire   Let man be free

    ONE OF THE SIGNERS

    Written for the unveiling of the statue of
    Josiah Bartlett at Amesbury Mass  July 4
    1888 Governor Bartlett who was a native
    of the town was a signer of the Declaration
    of Independence Amesbury or Anibresbury
    so called from the anointed stones of the
    great Druidical temple near it was the seat of
    one of the earliest religious houses in Britain
    The tradition that the guilty wife of King Ar
    thur fled thither for protection forms one of
    the finest passages in Tennysons Idylls of the
    King

    O STOKIED vale of Merrimac

    Rejoice through all thy shade and
    shine
    And from his centurys sleep call back

    A brave and honored son of thine

    Unveil his effigy between

    The living and the dead today

    The fathers of the Old Thirteen
    Shall witness bear as spirits may

    Unseen unheard his gray compeers
    The shades of Lee and Jefferson

    Wise Franklin reverend with his years
    And Carroll lord of Carrollton

    Be thine henceforth a pride of place
    Beyond thy namesakes oversea

    Where scarce a stone is left to trace
    The Holy House of Amesbury

    A prouder memory lingers round
    The birthplace of thy true man here

    Than that which haunts the refuge found
    By Arthurs mythic Guinevere

    The plain deal table where he sat
    And signed a nations titledeed

    Is dearer now to fame than that

    Which bore the scroll of Runnymede

    Long as on Freedoms natal morn
    Shall ring the Independence bells

    Give to thy dwellers yet unborn
    The lesson which his image tells

    For in that hour of Destiny

    Which tried the men of bravest stock
    He knew the end alone must be

    A free land or a traitors block



    ONE OF THE SIGNERS



    241



    Among those picked and cliosen men
    Than his who here first drew his breath

    No fiimer fingers hekl the pen
    Which wrote for liberty or death

    Not for their hearths and homes alone
    But for the world their work was done

    On all the winds their thought has flown
    Through all the circuit of the sun

    We trace its flight by broken chains
    By songs of grateful Labor still



    Today in all her holy fanes

    It rings the bells of freed Brazil

    O hills that watched his boyhoods home
    O earth and air that nursed him give

    In this memorial semblance room
    To him who shall its bronze outlive

    And thou O Land he loved rejoice
    That in the countless years to come

    Whenever Freedom needs a voice

    These sculptured lips shall not be dumb



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH

    It can scarcely be necessary to name as the
    two companions whom I reckoned with myself
    in this poetical picnic Fields the lettered mag
    nate and Taylor the free cosmopolite The
    long line of sandy beach which defines almost
    the whole of the New Hampshire seacoast is
    especially marked near its southern extremity
    by the saltmeadows of Hampton The Hamp
    ton River winds through these meadows and
    the reader may if he choose imagine my tent
    pitched near its moutli where also was the
    scene of the Wreck of River mouth The green
    bluff to the northward is Great Boars Head
    southward is the Merrimac with Newburyport
    lifting its steeples above brown roofs and green
    trees on its banks Mr Whittier originally
    designed following the Decameron method and
    feigning that eacli person read his own poem
    but abandoned it as too hackneyed

    I WOULD not sin in this half playful
    strain
    Too light perhaps for serious years
    though born
    Of the enforced leisure of slow pain

    Against the pure ideal which has drawn
    My feet to follow its farshining gleam
    A simple plot is mine  legends and runes
    Of credulous days old fancies that have lain
    Silent from boyhood taking voice again
    Warmed into life once more even as the

    tunes
    That frozen in the fabled huntinghorn
    Thawed into sound   a winter fireside

    dream
    Of dawns and smisets by the summer sea
    Whose sands are traversed by a silent

    throng
    Of voyagers from that vaster mystery
    Of which it is an emblem   and the dear
    Memory of one who might have tuned my

    song
    To sweeter music by her delicate ear



    When heats as of a tropic clime

    Burned all our inland valleys through



    Three friends the guests of summer
    time
    Pitched their white tent where sea
    winds blew
    Behind them marshes seamed and

    crossed
    With narrow creeks and flowerem
    bossed
    Stretched to the dark oak wood whose leafy

    arms
    Screened from the stormy East the pleasant
    inland farms

    At full of tide their bolder shore

    Of sunbleached sand the waters beat
    At ebb a smooth and glistening floor

    They touched with light receding feet
    Northward a green blulf broke the chain
    Of sandhills  southward stretched a
    plain
    Of salt grass with a river winding down
    Sailwhitened and beyond the steeples of
    the town

    Whence sometimes when the wind was
    light
    And dull the thunder of the beach
    They heard the bells of moiui and night
    Swing miles away their silver speech
    Above low scarp and turfgrown wall
    They saw the fortflag rise and fall
    And the first star to signal twilights

    hour
    The lampfire glimmer down from the tall
    lighthouse tower

    They rested there escaped awhile

    From cares that wear the life away
    To eat the lotus of the Nile

    And drink the poppies of Cathay
    To fling tlieir loads of custom down
    Like drift  weed on the sand  slopes
    brown
    And in the seawaves drown the restless

    pack
    Of duties claims and needs that barked
    upon their track



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    43



    One with his beard servrce silvered bore

    A ready credence in his looks
    A lettered magnate lording oer

    An everwidening realm of books
    In him braincurrents near and far
    Converged as in a Leyden jar
    The old dead authors thronged him round

    about
    And Elzevirs gray ghosts from leathern
    graves looked out

    He knew each living pundit well

    Could weigh the gifts of him or her
    And well the market value tell

    Of poet and philosopher
    But if he lost the scenes behind
    Somewhat of reverence vague and blind
    Finding the actors human at the best
    No readier lips than his the good he saw
    confessed

    Ilis boyhood fancies not outgrown

    He loved himself the singers art
    Tenderly gently by his own

    He knew and judged an authors heart

    No Khadamanthine brow of doom

    Bowed the dazed pedant from his room

    And bards whose name is legion if denied

    Bore off alike intact their verses and their

    pride

    Pleasant it was to roam about

    The lettered world as he had done
    And see the lords of song without

    Their singing robes and garlands on
    With Wordsworth paddle Rydal mere
    Taste rugged Elliotts homebrewed beer
    And with the ears of Rogers at fourscore
    Hear Garricks buskined tread and Wal
    poles wit once more

    And one there was a dreamer born

    Who with a mission to fidfil
    Had left the Muses haunts to turn

    The crank of an opinionmill
    Making his rustic reed of song
    A weapon in the war with wrong
    Yoking his fancy to the breakingplough
    That beauideej turned the soil for truth to
    spring and grow

    Too quiet seemed the man to ride
    The winged Hippogriff Reform

    Was his a voice from side to side
    To pieice the tumult of the storm



    A silent shy peaceloving man

    He seemed no fiery partisan
    To hold his way against the public frown
    The ban of Church and State the fierce
    mobs hounding down

    For while he wrought with strenuous will

    The work his hands had found to do
    He heard the fitful music still

    Of winds that out of dreamland blew

    The din about him could not drown

    What the strange voices whispered down

    Along his taskfield weird processions swept

    The visionary pomp of stately phantoms

    stepped

    The common air was thick with dreams

    He told them to the toiling crowd
    Such music as the woods and streams

    Sang in his ear he sang aloud
    In still shut bays on windy capes
    He heard the call of beckoning shajjes
    And as the gray old shadows prompted

    him
    To homely moulds of rhyme he shaped
    their legends grim

    He rested now his weary hands

    And lightly moralized and laughed
    As tracing on the shifting sands
    A burlesque of his papercraft
    He saw the careless waves oerrun
    His words as time before had done
    Each days tidewater washing clean away
    Like letters from the sand the work of
    yesterday

    And one whose Arab face was tanned

    By tropic sun and boreal fiost
    So travelled there was scarce a land

    Or people left him to exhaust
    In idling mood had from him hurled
    The poor squeezed orange of the world
    And in the tent  shade sat beneath a

    palm
    Smoked crosslegged like a Turk in Ori
    ental calm

    The very waves that washed the sand
    Below him he had seen before

    Whitening the Scandinavian strand
    And sultry Mauritanian shore

    From icerimmed isles from summer
    seas

    Palmfringed they bore him messages



    244



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    He heard the plaintive Nubian songs again
    And mulebells tinkling down the mountain
    paths of Spain

    His memory round the ransacked earth

    On Pucks long girdle slid at ease
    And instant to the valleys girth

    Of mountains spice isles of the seas
    Faith flowered in minster stones Arts

    guess
    At truth and beauty found access
    Yet loved the while that free cosmopolite
    Old friends old ways and kept his boy
    hoods dreams in sight

    Untouched as yet by wealth and pride

    That virgin innocence of beach
    No shingly monster hundredeyed

    Stared its gray sandbirds out of reach
    Unhoused save where at intervals
    The white tents showed their canvas
    walls
    Where brief sojourners in the cool soft

    air
    Forgot their inland heats hard toil and
    yearlong care

    Sometimes along the wheeldeep sand
    A onehorse wagon slowly crawled
    Deep laden with a youthful band

    Whose look some homestead old re
    called
    Brother perchance and sisters twain
    And one whose blue eyes told more
    plain
    Tlian the free language of her rosy lip
    Of the still dearer claim of loves relation
    ship

    With cheeks of russetorchard tint

    The light laugh of their native rills
    The perfume of their gardens mint

    The breezy freedom of the hills
    They bore in unrestrained delight
    The motto of the Garters knight
    Careless as if from every gazing thing
    Hid by their innocence as Gyges by his
    ring

    The clanging seafowl came and went
    The hunters gun in the marshes rang

    At nightfall from a neighboring tent
    A flutevoiced woman sweetly sang

    Loosehaired barefooted handinhand

    Yonng girls went tripping down the sand



    And youths and maidens sitting in the

    moon
    Dreamed oer the old fond dream from

    which we wake too soon

    At times their fishinglines they plied

    With an old Triton at the oar
    Salt as the seawind tough and dried

    As a lean cusk from Labrador
    Strange tales he told of wreck and

    storm
    Had seen the seasnakes awful form
    And heard the ghosts on Haleys Isle com
    plain
    Speak him off shore and beg a passage to
    old Spain

    And there on breezy morns they saw
    The fishingschooners outward run
    Their lowbent sails in tack and flaw
    Turned white or dark to shade and
    sun
    Sometimes in calms of closing day
    They watched the spectral mirage play
    Saw low far islands looming tall and nigh
    And ships with upturned keels sail like a
    sea the sky

    Sometimes a cloud with thunder black

    Stooped low upon the darkening main
    Piercing the waves along its track
    With the slant javelins of rain
    And when westwind and sunshine warm
    Chased out to sea its wrecks of storm
    They saw the prismy hues in thin spray

    showers
    Where the green buds of waves burst into
    white froth flowers

    And when along the line of shore

    The mists crept upward chill and
    damp
    Stretched careless on their sandy floor

    Beneath the flaring lantern lamp

    They talked of all things old and new

    Read slept and dreamed as idlers do

    And in the unquestioned freedom of the

    tent
    Body and oertaxed mind to healthful ease
    unbent

    Once when the sunset splendors died
    And trampling up the sloping sand

    In lines outreaching far and wide

    The whitemaned billows swept to land



    THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH



    245



    Dim seen across the gathering shade

    A vast and ghostly cavalcade
    They sat around their lighted kerosene
    Hearing the deep bass roar their every
    pause between

    Then urged thereto the Editor

    AVithin his full portfolio dipped
    Feigning excuse while searching for

    With secret pride his manuscript
    His pale face flushed from eye to beard
    With nervous cough his throat he cleared
    And in a voice so tremulous it betrayed
    The anxious fondness of an authors heart
    he read



    THE WRECK OF RIVERMOUTH

    The Goody Cole who figures in this poem and
    The Changeling was Eunice Cole who for a
    quarter of a century or more was feared per
    secuted and hated as the witch of Hampton
    She lived alone in a hovel a little distant from
    the spot where the Hampton Academy now
    stands and there she died unattended When
    her death was discovered she was hastily cov
    ered up in the earth near by and a stake
    driven throngh her body to exorcise the evil
    spirit Rev Stephen Bachiler or Batehelder
    was one of the ablest of the early New Eng
    land preachers His marriage late in life to a
    woman regarded by his church as disreputable
    induced him to return to England where he
    enjoyed the esteem and favor of Oliver Crom
    well during the Protectorate

    RiVERMOUTH Rocks are fair to see

    By dawn or sunset shone across
    When the ebb of the sea has left them
    free
    To dry their fringes of goldgreen moss
    For there the river comes whiding down
    From salt seameadows and uplands brown
    And waves on the outer rocks afoam
    Shout to its waters  Welcome home

    And fair are the sunny isles in view
    East of the grisly Head of the Boar

    And Agamenticus lifts its blue

    Disk of a cloud the woodlands oer

    And southerly when the tide is down

    Twixt white sea  waves and sand  hills
    brown

    The beachbirds dance and the gray gulls
    wheel

    Over a floor of burnished steel



    Once in the old Colonial days

    Two hundred years ago and more
    A boat sailed down through the winding
    ways
    Of Hampton River to that low shore
    Full of a goodly company
    Sailing out on the summer sea
    Veering to catch the landbreeze light
    With the Boar to left and the Rocks to
    right

    In Hampton meadows where mowers laid
    Their scythes to the swaths of salted
    grass
    Ah welladay  our hay must be made
    A young man sighed who saw them
    pass
    Loud laughed his fellows to see him stand
    Whetting his scythe with a listless hand
    Hearing a voice in a faroff song
    Watching a white hand beckoning long

    Fie on the witch   cried a merry girl
    As they romuled the point where Goody
    Cole

    Sat by her door with her wheel atwirl
    A bent and bleareyed poor old soul

    Oho   she muttered  ye re brave to
    day

    But I hear the little waves laugh and say

    The broth will be cold that waits at home

    For it s one to go but another to come

    She s cursed said the skipper   speak

    her fair
    I m scary always to see her shake
    Her wicked head with its wild gray hair
    And nose like a hawk and eyes like a

    snake
    But merrily still with laugh and shout
    From Hampton River the boat sailed out
    Till the huts and the flakes on Star seemed

    nigh
    And they lost the scent of the pines of Rye

    They dropped their lines in the lazy tide
    Drawing up haddock and mottled cod

    They saw not the Shadow that walked be
    side
    They heard not the feet with silence shod

    But thicker and thicker a hot mist grew

    Shot by the lightnings through and through

    And muffled growls like the growl of a
    beast

    Ran along the sky from west to east



    246



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Then tile skipper looked from the darken
    ing sea
    Up to the dimmed and wading sun
    But he spake like a brave man cheerily
    Yet there is time for our homeward
    run
    Veering and tacking they backward wore
    And just as a breath from the woods ashore
    Blew out to whisper of danger past
    The wrath of the storm came dovn at
    last

    The skipper hauled at the heavy sail

    God be our help   he only cried
    As the roaring gale like the stroke of a
    flail
    Smote the boat on its starboard side
    The Shoalsmen looked but saw alone
    Dark films of raincloud slantwise blown
    Wild rocks lit up by the lightnings glare
    The strife and torment of sea and air

    Goody Cole looked out from her door
    The Isles of Shoals were drowned and
    gone
    Scarcely she saw the Head of the Boar

    Toss the foam from tusks of stone
    She clasped her hands with a grip of pain
    The tear on her cheek was not of rain
    They are lost she muttered  boat and

    crew
    Lord forgive me  my words were true

    Suddenly seaward swept the squall

    The low sun smote through cloudy rack
    The Shoals stood clear in the light and all

    The trend of the coast lay hard and
    black
    But far and wide as eye could reach
    No life was seen upon wave or beach
    The boat that went out at morning never
    Sailed back again into Hampton River

    O mower lean on thy bended snath

    Look from the meadows green and low
    The wind of the sea is a waft of death

    The waves are singing a song of woe
    By silent river by moaning sea
    Long and vain shall thy watching be
    Never again shall the sweet voice call
    Never tlie white hand rise and fall

    O Rivermouth Rocks how sad a sight
    Ye saw in the light of breaking day
    Dead faces looking up cold and white



    From sand and seaweed where they lay
    The mad old witchwife wailed and wept
    And cursed the tide as it backward crept
    Crawl back crawl back blue watersnake
    Leave your dead for the hearts that break

    Solemn it was in that old day

    In Hampton town and its logbuilt
    church
    Where side by side the coffins lay

    And the mourners stood in aisle and
    porch
    In the singingseats young eyes were dim
    The voices faltered that raised the hymn
    And Father Dalton grave and stern
    Sobbed through his prayer and wept in turn

    But his ancient colleague did not pray

    Under the weight of his fourscore years
    He stood apart with the irongray

    Of his strong brows knitted to hide his
    tears
    And a fairfaced woman of doubtful fame
    Linking her own with his honored name
    Subtle as sin at his side withstood
    The felt reproach of her neighborhood

    Apart with them like them forbid

    Old Goody Cole looked drearily round
    As two by two with their faces hid

    The mourners walked to the burying
    ground
    She let the staff from her clasped hands

    fall
    Lord forgive us  we re sinners all
    And the voice of the old man answered her
    Amen   said Father Bachiler

    So as I sat upon Appledore

    In the calm of a closing summer day
    And the broken lines of Hampton shore

    In purple mist of cloudland lay
    The Rivermouth Rocks their story told
    And waves aglow with sunset gold
    Rising and breaking in steady chime
    Beat the rhythm and kept the time

    And the sunset paled and warmed once
    more
    With a softer tenderer afterglow
    In the east was moonrise with boats off
    shore
    And sails in the distance drifting slow
    The beacon glimmered from Portsmouth
    bar



    THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE



    247



    The White Isle kindled its great red star
    And life and death in my oldtime lay
    Mingled in peace like the night and day



    Well   said the Man of Books  yonr
    story
    Is really not ill told in verse
    As the Celt said of purgatory

    One might go farther and fare worse
    The Reader smiled  and once again
    With steadier voice took np his strain
    While the fair singer from the neighboring

    tent
    Drew near and at his side a graceful lis
    tener bent



    THE GRAVE BY THE LAKE

    At the mouth of the Melvin River which
    empties into Moultonboro Bay in Lake Winni
    pesaukee is a great mound The Ossipee In
    dians had their home in the neighborhood of
    the bay which is plentifully stocked with fish
    and many relics of their occupation have been
    found

    Where the Great Lakes sunny smiles
    Dimple round its hundred isles
    And the mountains granite ledge
    Cleaves the water like a wedge
    Ringed about with smooth gray stones
    Rest the giants mighty bones

    Close beside in shade and gleam
    Laughs and ripples Melvin stream
    Melvin water moujitainborn
    All fair flowers its banks adorn
    All the woodland voices meet
    Mingling with its murmurs sweet

    Over lowlands forestgrown
    Over waters islandstrown
    Over silversanded beach
    Leaflocked bay and misty reach
    Melvin stream and burialheap
    Watch and ward the mountains keep

    Who that Titan cromlech fills
    Forestkaiser lord o the hills
    Ruight who on the birchen tree
    Carved his savage heraklry
    Priest o the pinewood temples dim
    Prophet sage or wizard grim



    Rugged type of primal man
    Grim utilitarian

    Loving woods for hunt and prowl
    Lake and hill for fish and fowl
    As the brown bear blind and dull
    To the grand and beautiful

    Not for him the lesson drawn
    From the mountains smit with dawn
    Starrise moonrise flowers of May
    Sunsets purple bloom of day
    Took his life no hue from thence
    Poor amid such affluence

    Haply unto hill and tree
    All too near akin was he
    Unto him who stands afar
    Natures marvels greatest are
    Who the mountain purple seeks
    Must uot climb the higher peaks

    Yet who knows in winter tramp
    Or the midnight of the camp
    What revealings faint and far
    Stealing down from moon and star
    Kindled in that human clod
    Thought of destiny and God

    Stateliest forest patriarch

    Grand in robes of skin and bark

    What sepulchral mysteries

    What weird funeralrites were his

    What sharp wail what drear lament

    Back scared wolf and eagle sent

    Now whateer he may have been
    Low he lies as other men
    On his mound the partridge drums
    There the noisy bluejay comes
    Rank nor name nor pomp has he
    In the graves democracy

    Part thy blue lips Northern lake
    Mossgrown rocks your silence break
    Tell the tale thou ancient tree
    Thou too slideworn Ossipee
    Speak and tell us how and when
    Lived and died this king of men

    Wordless moans the ancient pine
    Lake and mountain give no sign
    Vain to trace this ring of stones
    Vain the search of crumbling bones
    Deepest of all mysteries
    And the saddest silence is

    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Nameless noteless clay with clay
    Mingles slowly day by day
    But somewhere for good or ill
    That dark soul is living still
    Somewhere yet that atoms force
    Moves the lightpoised universe

    Strange that on his burialsod
    Harebells bloom and goldenrod
    While the souls dark horoscope
    Holds no starry sign of hope
    Is the Unseen with sight at odds
    Natures pity more than Gods

    Thus I mused by Melvins side
    While the summer eventide
    Made the woods and inland sea
    And the mountains mystery
    And the hush of earth and air
    Seemed the pause before a prayer

    Prayer for him for all who rest

    Mother Earth upon thy breast

    Lapped on Christian turf or hid

    In rockcave or pyramid

    All who sleep as all who live

    Well may need the prayer  Forgive

    Desertsmothered caravan
    Kneedeep dust that once was man
    Battletrenches ghastly piled
    Oceanfloors with white bones tiled
    Crowded tomb and mounded sod
    Dumbly crave that prayer to God

    Oh the generations old

    Over whom no churchbells tolled

    Christless lifting up blind eyes

    To the silence of the skies

    For the innumerable dead

    Is my soul disquieted

    Where be now these silent hosts
    Where the campingground of ghosts
    Where the spectral conscripts led
    To the white tents of the dead
    What strange shore or chartless sea
    Holds the awful mystery

    Then the warm sky stooped to make
    Double sunset in the lake
    While above I saw with it
    Range on range the mountains lit
    And the calm and splendor stole
    Like an answer to my soul



    Hearst thou O of little faith
    What to thee the mountain saith
    What is whispered by the trees
    Cast on God thy care for these
    Trust Him if thy sight be dim
    Doubt for them is doubt of Him

    Blind must be their closeshut eyes
    Where like night the sunshine lies
    Fierylinked the selfforged chain
    Binding ever sin to pain
    Strong their prisonhouse of will
    But without He waiteth still

    Not with hatreds midertow
    Doth the Love Eternal flow
    Every chain that spirits wear
    Crumbles in the breath of prayer
    And the penitents desire
    Opens every gate of fire

    Still Thy love O Christ arisen
    Yearns to reach these souls in prison
    Through all depths of sin and loss
    Drops the plummet of Thy cross
    Never yet abyss was found
    Deeper than that cross could sound

    Therefore well may Nature keep
    Equal faith with all who sleep
    Set her watch of hills around
    Christian grave and heathen mound
    And to cairn and kirkyard send
    Simimers flowery dividend

    Keep O pleasant Melvin stream
    Thy sweet laugh in shade and gleam
    On the Indians grassy tomb
    Swing O flowers your bells of bloom
    Deep below as high above
    Sweeps the circle of Gods love



    He paused and questioned with his eye

    The hearers verdict on his song
    A low voice asked   Is t well to pry

    Into the secrets which belong
    Only to God   The life to be
    Is still the unguessed mystery

    Unsealed unpierced the cloudy walls re
    main
    We beat with dream and wish the soundless
    doors in vain



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH

    But faith beyond our sight may go
    He said   The gracious Fatherhood
    Cau only know above below
    Eternal purposes of good
    From our free heritage of will
    The bitter springs of pain and ill
    Flow only in all worlds The perfect day
    Of God is shadowless and love is love
    alway

    I know she said  the letter kills

    That on our arid fields of strife
    And heat of clashing texts distils

    The dew of spirit and of life
    But searching still the written Word
    I fain would find Thus saith the Lord
    A voucher for the hope I also feel
    That sin can give no wound beyond loves
    power to heal

    Pray said the Man of Books give oer

    A theme too vast for time and place
    Go on Sir Poet ride once more

    Your hobby at his old free pace
    But let him keep with step discreet
    The solid earth beneath his feet
    In the great mystery which around us lies
    The wisest is a fool the fool Heavenhelped
    is wise

    The Traveller said   If songs have
    creeds
    Their choice of them let singers make
    But Art no other sanction needs

    Than beauty for its own fair sake
    It grinds not in the mill of use
    Nor asks for leave nor begs excuse
    It makes tlie flexile laws it deigns to own
    And gives its atmosphere its color and its
    tone

    Confess old friend your austere school

    Has left your fancy little chance
    You scpiare to reasons rigid rule

    The flowing outlines of romance
    With conscience keen from exercise
    And chronic fear of compromise
    You check the free play of your rhymes

    to clap
    A moral underneath and spring it like a
    trap

    The sweet voice answered   Better so
    Than bolder flights that know no
    check



    Better to use the bit than throw

    The reins all loose on fancys neck
    The liberal range of Art should be
    The breadth of Christian liberty
    Restrained alone by challenge and alarm
    Where its charmed footsteps tread the bor
    der land of harm

    Beyond the poets sweet dream lives

    The eternal epic of the man
    He wisest is who only gives

    True to himself the best he can
    Who drifting in the winds of praise
    The inward monitor obeys
    And with the boldness that confesses fear
    Takes in the crowded sail and lets his con
    science steer

    Thanks for the fitting word he speaks
    Nor less for doubtful word unspoken
    For the false model that he breaks

    As for the moulded grace unbroken
    For what is missed and what remains
    For losses which are truest gains
    For reverence conscious of the Eternal eye
    And truth too fair to need the garnish of a
    lie

    Laughing the Critic bowed  I yield

    The point without another word
    Who ever yet a case appealed

    Where beautys judgment had been
    heard
    And you my good friend owe to me
    Your warmest thanks for such a plea
    As true withal as sweet For my offence
    Of cavil let her words be ample recom
    pense

    Across the sea one lighthouse star

    With crimson ray that came and went
    Revolving on its tower afar

    Looked through the doorway of the
    tent
    While outward over sandslopes wet
    The lamp flashed down its yellow jet
    On the long wash of waves with red and

    green
    Tangles of weltering weed through the
    white foamwreaths seen

    Sing while we may  another day
    May bring enongli of sorrow    thus

    Our Traveller in his own sweet lay
    His Crimean campsong hints to us

    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    The lady said  So let it be
    Sing us a song exclaimed all three
    She smiled   I can but marvel at your

    choice
    To hear our poets words through my poor
    borrowed voice



    Her window opens to the bay
    On glistening light or misty gray
    And there at dawn and set of day

    In prayer she kneels
    Dear Lord   she saith  to many a home
    From wind and wave the wanderers come
    I only see the tossing foam

    Of stranger keels

    Blown out and in by summer gales
    The stately ships with crowded sails
    And sailors leaning oer their rails

    Before me glide
    They come they go but nevermore
    Spiceladen from the Indian shore
    I see his swiftwinged Isidore

    The waves divide

    O Thou  with whom tlie night is day
    And one the near and far away
    Look out on yon gray waste and say

    Where lingers he
    Alive perchance on some lone beach
    Or thirsty isle beyond the reach
    Of man he hears the mocking speech

    Of wind and sea

    O dread and cruel deep reveal
    The secret which thy waves conceal
    And ye wild seabirds hither wheel

    And tell your tale
    Let winds that tossed his raven hair
    A message from my lost one bear
    Some thought of me a last fond prayer

    Or dying wail

    Come with your dreariest truth shut out
    The fears that haunt me roiind about
    O God  I cannot bear this doubt

    That stiiles breath
    The worst is better than the dread
    Give me but leave to mourn my dead
    Asleep in trust and hope instead

    Of life in death

    It might have been the evening breeze
    That whispered in the garden trees



    It might have been the sound of seas

    That rose and fell
    But with her heart if not her ear
    The old loved voice she seemed to hear
    I wait to meet thee  be of cheer

    For all is well



    The sweet voice into silence went
    A silence which was almost pain
    As through it rolled the long lament
    The cadence of the mournful main
    Glancing his written pages oer
    The Reader tried his part once more
    Leaving the land of hackmatack and pine
    For Tuscan valleys glad with olive and with
    vine



    THE BROTHER OF MERCY

    Suggested by reading C E Nortons account

    PiERO LucA kn6wn of all the town
    As the gray porter by the Pitti wall
    Where the noon shadows of the gardens
    fall
    Sick and in dolor waited to lay down
    His last sad burden and beside his mat
    The barefoot monk of La Certosa sat

    Unseen in square and blossoming garden
    drifted
    Soft sunset lights through green Val d

    Arno sifted
    Unheard below the living shuttles shifted
    Backward and forth and wove in love or

    strife
    In mirth or pain the mottled web of life
    But when at last came upward from the

    street
    Tinkle of bell and tread of measured feet
    The sick man started strove to rise in

    vain
    Sinking back heavily with a moan of pain
    And the monk said  T is but the Brother
    hood
    Of Mercy going on some errand good
    Their black masks by the palacewall I see
    Piero answered faintly  Woe is me
    This day for the first time in forty years
    In vain the bell hath sounded in my ears
    Calling me with my brethren of the mask
    Beggar and prince alike to some new task



    THE CHANGELING



    251



    Of love or pity  hiiply from the street
    To bear a wretch plaguestricken or with

    feet
    Hushed to the quickened ear and feverish

    brain
    To tread the crowded lazarettos floors
    Down the long twilight of the corridors
    Midst tossing arms and faces full of pain
    I loved the work  it was its own reward
    I never counted on it to offset
    My sins which are many or make less my

    debt
    To the free grace and mercy of our Lord
    But somehow father it has come to be
    In these long years so much a part of me
    I should not know myself if lacking it
    But with tlie work the worker too would die
    And in my place some other self would sit
    Joyful or sad  what matters if not I
    And now all s over Woe is me     My

    son
    The monk said soothingly  thy work is

    done
    And no more as a servant but the guest
    Of God thou enterest thy eternal rest
    No toil no tears no sorrow for the lost
    Shall mar tiiy perfect bliss Thou shalt sit

    down
    Clad in white robes and wear a golden

    crown
    Forever and forever  Piero tossed
    On his sickpillow   Miserable me
    I am too poor for such grand company
    The crown would be too iieavy for this gray
    Old head  and God forgive me if I say
    It would be hard to sit there night and day
    Like an image in the Tribune doing naught
    With these hard hands tiiat all my life have

    wrouglit
    Not for bread only but for pitys sake
    I m dull at prayers  I could not keep

    awake
    Counting my beads Mine s but a crazy

    head
    Scarce worth the saving if all else be dead
    And if one goes to heaven without a heart
    God knows he leaves behind his better part
    I love my fellowmen  the worst I know
    I would do good to Will death change

    mo so
    That I shall sit among the lazy saints
    Turning a deaf ear to the sore complaints
    Of souls tliat suffer  Why I never yet
    Left a poor dog in the strnla hard beset
    Or ass oerladen  Must I rate man less



    Than dog or ass in holy selfishness

    Methinks Lord pardon if the thought be
    sin

    The world of pain were better if therein

    Ones heart might still be human and de
    sires

    Of natural pity drop upon its fires

    Some cooling tears

    Thereat the pale monk crossed

    His brow and muttering  Madman  thou
    art lost

    Took up his pyx and fled  and left alone

    The sick man closed his eyes with a great
    groan

    That sank into a prayer  Thy will be
    done

    Then was he made aware by soul or ear
    Of somewhat pure and holy bending oer

    him
    And of a voice like that of her who bore

    him
    Tender and most compassionate   Never

    fear
    For heaven is love as God himself is love
    Thy work below shall be thy work above
    And when he looked lo in the stern

    monks place
    He saw the shininsj of an angfels face



    The Traveller broke the pause  I ve seen
    The Brothers down the long street steal
    Black silent masked the crowd between

    And felt to doff my hat and kneel
    With heart if not with knee in prayer
    For blessings on their pious care
    The Reader wiped his glasses   Friends

    of mine
    We 11 try our homebrewed next instead
    of foreign wine



    THE CHANGELING

    For the fairest maid in Hampton
    They needed not to search

    Who saw young Anna Favor
    Come walking into church

    Or bringing from the meadows

    At set of harvestday
    The frolic of the blackbirds

    The sweetness of the hay



    252



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Now the weariest of all mothers
    The saddest two years bride

    She scowls ill the face of her husband
    And spurns her child aside

    Rake out the red coals goodman

    For there the child shall lie
    Till the black witch comes to fetch her

    And both up chimney tly

    It s never my own little daughter
    Its never my own she said

    The witches have stolen my Anna
    And left me an imp instead

    Oh fair and sweet was my baby
    Blue eyes and hair of gold

    But this is ugly and wrinkled
    Cross and cunning and old

    I hate the touch of her fingers

    I hate the feel of her skin
    It s not the milk from my bosom

    But my blood that she sucks in

    My face grows sharp with the torment
    Look  my arms are skin and bone

    Rake open the red coals goodman
    And the witch shall have her own

    She 11 come when she hears it crying
    In the shape of an owl or bat

    And she 11 bring us our darling Anna
    In place of her screeching brat

    Then the goodman Ezra Daltou
    Laid his hand upon her head

    Thy sorrow is great O woman
    I sorrow with thee he said

    The paths to trouble are many
    And never but one sure way

    Leads out to the light beyond it
    My poor wife let us pray

    Then he said to the great AllFather
    Thy daughter is weak and blind

    Let her sight come bacR and clothe her
    Once more in her right mind

    Lead her out of this evil shadow

    Out of these fancies wild
    Let the holy love of the mother

    Turn asain to her child



    Make her lips like the lips of Mary

    Kissing her blessed Son
    Let her hands like the hands of Jesus

    Rest on her little one

    Comfort the soul of thy handmaid

    Open her prisondoor
    And thine shall be all the glory

    And praise forevermore

    Then into the face of its mother
    The baby looked up and smiled

    And the cloud of her soul was lifted
    And she knew her little child

    A beam of the slant west smishine
    Made the wan face almost fair

    Lit the blue eyes jjatient wonder
    And the rings of pale gold hair

    She kissed it on lip and forehead
    She kissed it on cheek and chin

    And she bared her snowwhite bosom
    To the lips so pale and thin

    Oh fair on her bridal morning

    Was the maid who blushed and smiled
    But fairer to Ezra Daltoii

    Looked the mother of his child

    With more than a lovers fondness
    He stooped to her worn young face

    And the nursing child and the mother
    He folded in one embrace

    Blessed be God   he murmured

    Blessed be God   she said
    For I see who once was blinded

    I live who once was dead

    Now mount and ride my goodman
    As thou lovest thy own soul

    Woe s me if my wicked fancies
    Be the death of Goody Cole

    His horse he saddled and bridled

    And into the night rode he
    Now through the great black woodland

    Now by the whitebeached sea

    He rode through the silent clearings

    He came to the ferry wide
    And thrice he called to the boatman
    I Asleep on the other side



    THE MAIDS OF ATTITASH



    253



    He set his horse to the river
    He swam to Newhury town

    And he called up Justice Sewall
    In his nightcap and his gown

    And the grave and worshipful justice
    Upon whose soul be peace

    Set his name to the jailers warrant
    For Goodwife Coles release

    Then through the night the houfbeats
    Went sounding like a flail

    And Goody Cole at cockcrow
    Came forth from Ipswich jail



    Here is a rhyme  I hardly dare

    To venture on its theme worn out
    What seems so sweet by Doon and Ayr

    Sounds simply silly hereabout
    And pipes by lips Arcadian blown
    Are only tin horns at our own
    Yet still the muse of pastoral walks with

    us
    While Hosea Biglow sings our new Theoc
    ritus

    THE MAIDS OF ATTITASH

    Attitasli an Indian word signif ying  huckle
    berry is the name of a large and beautiful
    lake in the northern part of Amesbury In a
    letter to Mr Fields Whittier wrote   I should
    like to show thee Attitasli as it is as pretty
    as St Marys Lake which Wordsworth sings
    in fact a great deal prettier The glimpse of
    the Pawtuckaway range of mountains in Not
    tingham seen across it is very fine and it has
    noble groves of puies and maples and ash
    trees

    In sky and wave the white clouds swam
    And the blue hills of Xuttiiigham

    Througb gajjs of leafy green

    Across the lake were seen

    When in the shadow of the ash
    That dreams its dream in Attitash

    In the warm summer weather

    Two maidens sat together

    They sat and watched in idle mood
    The gleam and shade of lake and wood

    The beach the keen light smote

    The white sail of a boat



    Swan flocks of lilies shoreward lying
    In sweetness not in music dying
    Hardback and virginsbower
    And whitespiked clethraHower

    With careless ears they heard the plash
    And breezy wash of Attitash

    The woodbirds plaintive cry

    The locusts sharp reply

    And teased the while with jdayfnl hand
    The shaggy dog of Newfoundhmd

    Whose uncouth frolic spilled

    Their baskets berryfilled

    Then one the beauty of whose eyes
    Was evermore a great surprise

    Tossed back her queenly head

    And lightly laughing said

    No bridegrooms hand be mine to hold
    That is not lined with yellow gold

    I tread no cottagefloor

    I own no lover poor

    My love must come on silken wings
    With bridal lights of diamond rings

    Not foul with kitchen smirch

    With tallowdip for torch

    The other on whose modest head
    Was lesser dower of beauty shed

    With look for homehearths meet

    And voice exceeding sweet

    Answered  We will not rivals be

    Take thou the gold leave love to me
    Mine be the cottage small
    And thine the rich mans hall

    I know indeed that wealth is good

    But lowly roof and simple food
    With love that hath no doubt
    Are more than gold without

    Hard by a farmer hale and young
    His cradle in the ryefield swung
    Tracking the yellow plain
    With windrows of ripe grain

    And still wheneer he paused to whet
    His scythe the sidelong glance he met

    Of large dark eyes where strove

    False pride and secret love



    254



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Be stroug young mower of the grain


    Her haughty vow is still vmsaid


    That love shall overmatch disdain


    But all she dreamed and coveted


    Its instincts soon or late


    Wears half to her surprise


    The heart shall vindicate


    The youthful farmers guise


    In hlouse of gray with fishingrod


    With more than all her oldtime pride


    Half screened by leaves a stranger trod


    She walks the ryefield at his side


    The margin of the pond


    Careless of cot or hall


    Watching the group beyond


    Since love transfigures all


    The supreme hours unnoted come


    Rich beyond dreams the vantagegromid


    Unfelt the turning tides of doom


    Of life is gained  her hands have found


    And so the maids laughed on


    The talisman of old


    Nor dreamed what Fate had done


    That changes all to gold


    Nor knew the step was Destinys


    While she who could for love dispense


    That rustled in the birchen trees


    With all its glittering accidents


    As with their lives forecast


    And trust her heart alone


    Fisher and mower passed


    Finds love and gold her own


    Erelong by lake and rivulet side


    What wealth can buy or art can build


    The summer roses paled and died


    Awaits her  but her cup is filled


    And Autumns fingers shed


    Even now unto the brim


    The maples leaves of red


    Her world is love and him


    Through the long goldhazed afternoon






    Alone but for the diving loon




    The partridge in the brake


    The while he heard the Bookman drew


    The black duck on the lake


    A length of makebelieving face




    With smothered mischief laughing


    Beneath the shadow of the ash


    through


    Sat man and maid by Attitash


    Why you shall sit in Ramsays place


    And earth and air made room


    And with his Gentle Shepherd keep


    For human hearts to bloom


    On Yankee hills immortal sheep




    While lovelorn swains and maids the seas


    Soft spread the carpets of the sod


    beyond


    And scarletoak and goldenrod

    With blushes and with smiles

    The Traveller laughed   Sir Galahad


    The mellow light the lake aslant


    Singing of love the Trouveres lay


    The pebbled margins ripplechant


    How should he know the blindfold lad


    Attempered and lowtoned


    From one of Vulcans forgeboys


    The tender mystery owned


    Nay




    He better sees who stands outside


    And through the dream the lovers dreamed


    Than they who in procession ride


    Sweet sounds stole in and soft lights


    The Reader answered   selectmen and


    streamed

    The sunshine seemed to bless


    Miss while they make the show that way


    The air was a caress

    Not she who lightly laughed is there


    Here is a wld tale of the North


    With scornfid toss of midnight hair


    Our travelled friend will own as one

    KALLUNDBORG CHURCH



    255



    They tell it in the valleys green
    Of the fair island he has seen
    Low lying off the pleasant Swedish shore
    Washed by the Baltic Sea and watched by
    Elsinore



    KALLUNDBORG CHURCH

    Tie stille barn min
    Imorgeu kommer Fin
    Faer din
    Og gier dig Esberu Snares oine og hjerte at lege med

    Zealand Rhyme

    Build at Kallundborg by the sea
    A church as stately as church may be
    And there shalt thou wed my daughter

    fair
    Said the Lord of Nesvek to Esbern Snare

    And the Baron laughed But Esbern said
    Though I lose my soul I will Helva wed
    And oft he strode in his pride of will
    To the Troll who dwelt in Ulshoi hill

    Build O Troll a church for me
    At Kallundborg by the mighty sea
    Build it stately and build it fair
    Build it quickly said Esbern Snare

    But the sly Dwarf said  No work is

    wrought
    By Trolls of the Hills O man for naught
    What wilt thou give for thy church so fair
    Set thy own price quoth Esberu Snare

    When Kallundborg church is builded well
    Thou must the name of its builder tell
    Or thy heart and thy eyes must be my

    boon
    Build said Esbern  and build it soon

    By night and by day the Troll wrought

    on
    He hewed the timbers he piled the stone
    But day by day as the walls rose fair
    Darker and sadder grew Esberu Snare

    He listened by night he watched by day
    He sought and thought but he dared not

    pray
    In vain he called on the Ellemaids shy
    And the Neck and the Nis gave no reply

    Of his evil bargain far and wide

    A rumor ran through the countryside



    And Helva of Nesvek young and fair
    Prayed for the soul of Esbern Snare

    And now the church was wellnigh done

    One pillar it lacked and one alone

    And the grim Troll muttered  Fool thou

    art
    Tomorrow gives me thy eyes and heart

    By Kallundborg in black despair
    Through wood and meadow walked Esbern

    Snare
    Till worn and weary the strong man

    sank
    Under the birches on Ulshoi bank

    At his last days work he heard the Troll
    Hammer and delve in the quarrys hole
    Before him the church stood large and

    fair
    I have builded my tomb said Esbern

    Snare

    And he closed his eyes the sight to hide
    When he heard a light step at his side
    O Esbern Snare   a sweet voice said
    Would I might die now in thy stead

    With a grasp by love and by fear made

    strong
    He held her fast and he held her long
    With the beating heart of a bird afeard
    She hid her face in liis flamered beard

    O love   he cried  let me look today
    In thine eyes ere mine are plucked away
    Let me hold thee close let me feel thy

    heart
    Ere mine by the TioU is torn apart

    I sinned O Helva for love of thee
    Pray that the Lord Christ pardon me
    But fast as she prayed and faster still
    Hammered the Troll in Ulshoi hill

    He knew as he wrought that a loving

    heart
    Was somehow baffling his evil art
    For more than spell of Elf or Troll
    Is a maidens prayer for her lovers soul

    And Esbern listened and caught the sound
    Of a Trollwife singing underground
    Tomorrow comes Fine father thine
    Lie still and hush thee baby mine



    256



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Lie still my darling  next sunrise
    Thou It play with Esbern Suares heart and



    eyes



    Ho  ho   quoth Esbern  is that your

    game
    Thanks to the Trollwife I know his

    name

    Tlie Troll he heard him and hurried on
    To Kalluudborg church with the lacking

    stone
    Too late Gaffer Fine   cried Esbern

    Snare
    And Troll and pillar vanished in air

    That night the harvesters heard the sound

    Of a woman sobbing underground

    And the voice of the HillTroll loud with

    blame
    Of the careless singer who told his name

    Of the Troll of the Church they sing the

    rune
    By the Northern Sea in the harvest moon
    And the fishers of Zealand hear him still
    Scolding his wife in Ulshoi hill

    And seaward over its groves of birch
    Still looks the tower of Kalluudborg church
    Where first at its altar a wedded pair
    Stood Helva of Nesvek and Esbern Snare



    What asked the Traveller  would
    our sires
    The old Norse storytellers say
    Of sungraved pictures ocean wires

    And smoking steamboats of today
    And this O lady by your leave
    Recalls your song of yester eve
    Pray let us have that Cablehymn once

    more
    Hear hear   the Bookman cried  the
    lady has the floor

    These noisy waves below perhaps

    To such a strain will lend their ear
    With softer voice and lighter lapse

    Come stealing up the sands to hear
    And what they once refused to do
    For old King Knut accord to you
    Nay even the fishes shall your listeners be
    As once the legend runs they heard St
    Anthony



    THE CABLE HYMN

    O LONELY bay of Trinity

    O dreary shores give ear
    Lean down unto the whitelipped sea

    The voice of God to hear

    From world to world His couriers fly
    Thouglitwinged and shod with fire

    The angel of His stormy sky
    Rides down the sunken wire

    What saith the herald of the Lord

    The worlds long strife is done
    Close wedded by that mystic cord

    Its continents are one

    And one in heart as one in blood

    Shall all her peoples be
    The hands of human brotherhood

    Are clasped beneath the sea

    Through Orient seas oer Af rics plain

    And Asian mountains borne
    The vigor of the Northern brain

    Shall nerve the world outworn

    From clime to clime from shore to shore

    Shall thrill the magic thread
    The new Prometheus steals once more

    The fire that wakes the dead

    Throb on strong pulse of thunder  beat
    From answering beach to beach

    Fuse nations in thy kindly heat
    And melt the chains of each

    Wild terror of the sky above
    Glide tamed and dumb below

    Bear gently Oceans carrierdove
    Thy errands to and fro

    Weave on swift shuttle of the Lord

    Beneath the deep so far
    The bridal robe of earths accord

    The funeral shroud of war

    For lo  the fall of Oceans wall
    Space mocked and time outrun

    And round the world the thought of all
    Is as the thought of one

    The poles unite the zones agree
    The tongues of striving cease



    THE DEAD SHIP OF HARPSWELL

    As on the Sea of Galilee

    The Christ is whispering Peace



    Glad prophecy  to this at last

    The Reader said shall all things
    come
    Forgotten be the bugles blast

    And battlemusic of the drum
    A little while the world may run
    Its old mad way with needlegini

    riie cradlesong of Christ was never sung
    in vain

    Shifting his scattered papers  Here
    He said as died the faint applause
    Is something that I found last year

    Down on the island known as Orrs
    I had it from a fairhaired girl
    Who oddly bore the name of Pearl
    As if by some droll freak of circumstance
    Classic or welinigh so in Harriet Stowes

    THE DEAD SHIP OF HARPSWELL

    HAT flecks the outer gray beyond

    The sundowns golden trail
    Che white flash of a seabirds wing

    Or gleam of slanting sail
    liet young eyes watch from Neck and Point

    And seaworn elders pray
    rhe ghost of what was once a ship

    Is sailing up the bay

    From gray seafog from icy drift

    From peril and from pain
    riie homebound fislier greets thy lights

    O hundredharbored Maine
    But many a keel shall seaward turn

    And many a sail outstand

    Against the dusk of land

    She rounds the headlands bristling pines

    She threads the isleset bay
    No spur of breeze can speed her on

    Nor ebb of tide delay
    Old men still walk the Isle of Orr

    Who tell her date and name
    Old shipvrights sit in Frceport yards

    What weary doom of baffled quest

    Thou sad seaghost is thine
    What makes thee in the haunts of home

    A wonder and a sign
    No foot is on thy silent deck

    Upon thy helm no hand
    No ripple hath the soundless wind

    That smites thee from the land

    For never comes the ship to port

    Howeer the bieeze may be
    Just when she nears the waiting shore

    She drifts again to sea
    No tack of sail nor turn of helm

    Nor sheer of veering side
    Sternfore she drives to sea and night

    Against the wind and tide

    In vain oer Harpswell Neck the star

    Of evening guides her in
    In vain for her the lamps are lit

    Within thy tower Seguin
    In vain the harborboat shall hail

    In vain the pilot call
    No hand shall reef her spectral sail

    Or let her anchor fall

    Shake brown old wives with dreary joy

    Your grayhead hints of ill
    And over sickbeds whispering low

    Your prophecies fulfil
    Some home amid yon birchen trees

    Shall drape its door with woe
    And slowly wliere the Dead Ship sails

    The burial boat shall row

    From Wolf Neck and from Flying Point

    From island and from main
    From slieltered cove and tided creek

    Shall glide the funeral train
    The deadboat witli the bearers four

    The mourners at her stern
    And one shall go the silent way

    Who shall no more return

    And men shall sigh and women weep

    Whose dear ones pale and pine
    And sadly over sunset seas

    Await the ghostly sign

    THE PALATINE

    Block Island in Long Island Sound called
    by the Indians Manisees the isle of the little
    god was the scene of a tragic incident a hun
    dred years or more ago when The Palatine an
    emigrant ship bomid for Philadelphia driven
    off its course came upon the coast at this point
    A mutiny on hoard followed by an inhuman
    desertion on the part of the crew had brought
    the unhappy passengers to the verge of starva
    tion and madness Tradition says that wreck
    ers on shore after rescuing all but one of the
    survivors set fire to the vessel which was driven
    out to sea before a gale which had sprung up
    Every twelvemonth according to the same tradi
    tion the spectacle of a ship on fire is visible to
    the inhabitants of the island

    Leagues north as fly the gull and auk
    Point Judith watches with eye of hawk
    Leagues south thy beacon flames Mon
    tauk

    Lonely and windshorn woodforsaken
    With never a tree for Spring to waken
    For tryst of lovers or farewells taken

    Circled by waters that never freeze
    Beaten by billow and swept by breeze
    Lieth the island of Manisees

    Set at the mouth of the Sound to hold
    The coast lights up on its turret old
    Yellow with moss and seafog moidd

    Dreary the land when gust and sleet
    At its doors and windows howl and beat
    And Winter laughs at its fires of peat

    But in summer time when pool and

    pond
    Held in the laps of valleys fond
    Are blue as the glimpses of sea beyond



    When the hills are sweet with the brier
    rose
    And hid in the warm soft dells unclose
    Flowers the mainland rarely knows

    When boats to their morning fishing go
    And held to the wind and slanting low
    Whitening and darkening the small sails
    show

    Then is that lonely island fair

    And the pale healthseeker findeth there

    The wine of life in its pleasant air

    No greener valleys the sun invite
    On smoother beaches no seabirds light
    No blue waves shatter to foam more
    white

    There circling ever their narrow range

    Quaint tradition and legend strange

    Live on unchallenged and know no change

    Old wives spinning their webs of tow

    Or rocking weirdly to and fro

    In and out of the peats dull glow

    And old men mending their nets of twine
    Talk together of dream and sign
    Talk of the lost ship Palatine

    The ship that a hundred years before
    Freighted deep with its goodlj store
    In the gales of the equinox went ashore

    Tlie eager islanders one by one
    Counted the shots of her signal gun
    And heard the crash when she drove right
    on

    Into the teeth of death she sped
    May God forgive the hands that fed
    The false lights over the rocky Head

    O men and brothers  what sights were

    there
    White upturned faces hands stretched in

    prayer
    Where waves had pity could ye not spare

    Down swooped the wreckers like birds of

    prey
    Tearing the heart of the ship away
    And the dead had never a word to say

    259



    And then with ghastly shimmer and

    shine
    Over the iocks and the seething brine
    They burned the wreck of the Palatine

    In their cruel hearts as they homeward

    sped
    The sea and the rocks are dumb they

    said
    There 11 be no reckoning with the dead

    But the year went round and when once

    more
    Along their foamwhite curves of shore
    They heard the linestorm rave aud roar

    Behold  again with shimmer and shine
    Over the rocks and the seething brine
    The flaming wreck of the Palatine

    So haply in fitter words than these
    Mending their nets on their patient knees
    They tell the legend of Manisees

    Nor looks nor tones a doiibt betray

    It is known to us all they quietly

    say
    We too have seen it in our day

    Is there then no death for a word once

    spoken
    Was never a deed but left its token
    Written on tables never broken

    Do the elements subtle reflections give
    Do pictures of all the ages live
    On Natures infinite negative

    Which half in sport in malice half

    She shows at times with shudder or

    laugh
    Phantom and shadow in photograph

    For still on many a moonless night
    From Kingston Head and from Montauk

    light
    The spectre kindles and burns in sight

    Now low and dim now clear and higher
    Leaps up the terrible Ghost of Fire
    Then slowly sinking the flames expire

    And the wise Sound skippers though skies
    be fine



    Reef their sails when they see the sign
    Of the blazing wreck of the Palatine



    A fitter tale to scream than sing
    The Bookman said  Well fancy
    then
    The Reader answered  on the wing

    The seabirds shriek it not for men
    But in the ear of wave and breeze
    Tlie Traveller mused   Your Manisees
    Is fairyland  off Narragansett shore
    Who ever saw the isle or heard its name
    before

    T is some strange land of Flyaway

    Whose dreamy shore the ship beguiles
    St Brandans in its seamist gray

    Or sunset loom of Fortunate Isles
    No ghost but solid turf and rock
    Is the good island known as Block
    The Reader said For beauty and for

    ease
    I chose its Indian name softflowing Mani
    sees

    But let it pass  here is a bit

    Of iinrhymed story with a hint
    Of the old preaching mood in it

    The sort of sidelong moral squint
    Our friend objects to which has grown
    I fear a liabit of my own
    T was written when the Asian plague drew

    near
    And the land held its breath and paled
    with sudden fear



    ABRAHAM DAVENPORT

    The famous Dark Day of New England May
    19 1780 was a physical puzzle for many years
    to our ancestors but its oecnrrence brought
    something more than philosophical speculation
    into the minds of those who passed through it
    The incident of Colonel Abraham Davenports
    sturdy protest is a matter of history

    In the old days a custom laid aside
    With breeches and cocked hats the people

    sent
    Their wisest men to make the public laws
    And so from a brown homestead where the

    Sound



    26o



    THE TENT ON THE BEACH



    Drinks the small tribute of the Mianas
    Waved over by the woods of Rippowams
    And hallowed by pure lives and tranquil

    deaths
    Stamford sent up to the councils of the State
    Wisdom and grace iu Abraham Davenport

    T was on a Mayday of the far old year
    Seventeen hundred eighty that there fell
    Over the bloom and sweet life of the Spring
    Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon
    A horror of great darkness like the night
    In day of which the Norland sagas tell
    The Twilight of the Gods The lowhung

    sky
    Was black with ominous clouds save where

    its rim
    Was fringed with a dull glow like that

    which climbs
    The craters sides from the red hell below
    Birds ceased to sing and all the barnyard

    fowls
    Roosted  the cattle at the pasture bars
    Lowed and looked homeward  bats on

    leathern wings
    Flitted abroad  the sounds of labor died
    Men prayed and women wept  all ears

    grew sharp
    To hear the doom blast of the trumpet

    shatter
    The black sky that the dreadful face of

    Christ
    Might look from the rent clouds not as

    he looked
    A loving guest at Bethany but stern
    As Justice and inexorable Law

    Meanwhile in the old State House dim
    as ghosts
    Sat the lawgivers of Connecticut
    Trembling beneath their legislative robes
    It is the Lords Great Day  Let us ad
    journ
    Some said  and then as if with one accord
    All eyes were turned to Abraham Daven
    port
    He rose slow cleaving with his steady voice
    The intolerable hush  This well may be
    The Day of Judgment which the world

    awaits
    But be it so or not I only know
    My present duty and my Lords command
    To occupy till He come So at the post
    Where He hath set me in His providence



    I choose for one to meet Him face to

    face
    No faithless servant frightened from my

    task
    But ready when the Lord of the harvest

    calls
    And therefore with all reverence I would

    say
    Let God do His work we will see to

    ours
    Bring in the candles And they brought

    them in

    Then by the flaring lights the Speaker
    read
    Albeit vith husky voice and shaking hands
    An act to amend an act to regulate
    The shad and alewive fisheries Where
    upon
    Wisely and well spake Abraham Davenport
    Straight to the question with no figures of

    speech
    Save the ten Arab signs yet not without
    The shrewd dry humor natural to the man
    His awestruck colleagues listening all the

    while
    Between the pauses of his argument
    To hear the thimder of the wrath of God
    Break from the hollow trumpet of the cloud

    And there he stands in memory to this
    day
    Erect selfpoised a rugged face half seen
    Against the background of unnatural dark
    A witness to the ages as they pass
    That simple duty hath no place for fear



    He ceased  just then the ocean seemed

    To lift a halffaced moon in sight
    And shore  ward oer the waters
    gleamed
    From crest to crest a line of light
    Such as of old with solemn awe
    The fishers by Gennesaret saw
    When dryshod oer it walked the Son of

    God
    Tracking the waves with light whereer his
    sandals trod

    Silently for a space each eye

    Upon that sudden glory turned
    Cool from the land the breeze blew by



    THE WORSHIP OF NATURE



    261



    The tentropes flapped the long beach
    churned
    Its waves to foam  on either hand
    Stretched far as sight the liills of sand
    With bays of marsh and capes of bush

    and tree
    The woods black shoreline loomed beyond
    the meadowy sea

    The lady rose to leave  One song
    Or hymn they urged  before we
    part
    And she with lips to which belong

    Sweet intuitions of all art
    Gave to the winds of night a strain
    Which they who heard would hear again
    And to her voice the solemn ocean lent
    Touching its harp of sand a deep accom
    paniment



    THE WORSHIP OF NATURE

    The harp at Natures advent strung

    Has never ceased to play
    The song the stars of morning sung

    Has never died away

    And prayer is made and praise is given

    By all things near and far
    The ocean looketh up to heaven

    And mirrors every star

    Its waves are kneeling on the strand

    As kneels the human knee
    Their white locks bowing to the sand

    The priesthood of the sea

    They pour their glittering treasures forth
    Their gifts of pearl they bring

    And all the listening hills of earth
    Take up the song they sing

    The green earth sends her incense up
    From many a mountain shrine

    From folded leaf and dewy cup
    She pours her sacred wine



    The mists above the morning rills
    Rise wliite as wings of prayer

    The altarcurtains of the hills
    Are sunsets purple air

    The winds with hymns of praise are loud

    Or low with sobs of pain
    The thunderorgan of the cloud

    The diopping tears of rain

    With drooping head and branches crossed

    The twilight forest grieves
    Or speaks with tongues of Pentecost

    From all its sunlit leaves

    The blue sky is the temples arch

    Its transept earth and air
    The music of its starry march

    The chorus of a prayer

    So Nature keeps the reverent frame

    With which her years began
    And all her signs and voices shame

    The prayerless heart of man



    The singer ceased The moons white rays
    Fell on the rapt still face of her
    Allah il Allah  He hath praise

    From all things said the Traveller
    Oft from the deserts silent nights

    And mountain hymns of sunset lights
    My heart has felt rebuke as in his tent
    The Moslems prayer has shamed my
    Christian knee unbent

    He paused and lo  far faint and slow
    The bells in Newburys steeples tolled
    The twelve dead hours  the lamp burned
    low
    The singer sought her canvas fold
    One sadly said  At break of day
    We strike our tent and go our way
    But one made answer cheerily  Never fear
    We 11 pitch this tent of ours in type an
    other year

    American AntiSlaveiy Society in Philadel
    phia December 1833

    Champion of those who groan beneath

    Oppressions iron hand
    In view of jjennry hate and death

    I see thee fearless stand
    Still bearing up thy lofty brow

    In the steadfast strength of truth
    In manhood sealing well the vow

    And promise of thy youth

    Go on for thou hast chosen well

    On in the strength of God
    Long as one human heart sliall swell

    Beneath tlie tyrants rod
    Speak in a slumbering nations ear

    As thou hast ever spoken
    Until the dead in sin shall hear

    The fetters link be broken

    I love thee with a brothers love

    I feel my pidses thrill
    To mark thy spirit soar above

    The cloud of human ill
    My heart liath leaped to answer thine

    And echo back thy words
    As leaps the warriors at the shine

    And flash of kindred swords

    They tell me thou art rash and vain

    A searcher after fame
    That thon art striving but to gain

    A longenduring name
    That thou hast nerved the Africs hand

    And steeled the Africs heart
    To shake aloft his vengeful brand

    And rend his chain apart

    Have I not known thee well and read

    Thy mighty purpose long
    And watched the trials which have made

    Thy human spirit strong



    And shall the slanderers demon breath

    Avail with one like me
    To dina the sunshine of my faith

    And earnest trust in thee

    Go on the daggers point may glare

    Amid thy pathways gloom
    The fate which sternly threatens there

    Is glorious martyrdom
    Then onward with a martyrs zeal

    And wait thy sure reward
    When man to man no more shall kneel

    And God alone be Lord



    TOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE

    Toussaint LOuverture the black chieftain
    of Hayti was a slave on the plantation  de
    Libertas belonging to M Bayou When the
    rising of the ntgroes took place in 1791
    Toussaint refused to join them until he had
    aided M Bayou and his family to escape to
    Baltimore The white man had discovered in
    Toussaint many noble qualities and had in
    structed liim in some of the first branches of
    education  and the preservation of his life was
    owing to the negros gratitude for this kind
    ness

    In 1797 Toussaint LOuverture was ap
    pointed by the French government General
    inChief of the armies of iSt Domingo and as
    such signed the Convention with General
    Maitland for the evacuation of the island by
    the British From this period until 1801 the
    island under the government of Toussaint
    was liappy tranquil and prosperous The
    miserable attempt of Napoleon to reestablish
    slavery in JSt Domingo although it failed of
    its intended obiect proved fatal to the negro
    chieftain Treacherously seized by Leclerc
    he was hurried on board a vessel by night and
    conveyed to France where he was confined in
    a cold subterranean dungeon at IJesangon
    where in April 180J he died The tr atment
    of Toussaint finds a parallel only in the mur
    der of the Duke DEnghien It was the re
    mark of Godwin in his Lectures that the
    West India Islands since their first discovery



    TOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE

    by Columbus could not boast of a single name
    which deserves comparison with that of Tous
    saint LOuverture

    TwAS night The tranquil moonlight

    smile
    With wliich Heaven dreams of Earth

    shed down
    Its beauty on the Indian isle

    On broad green field and whitewalled

    town
    And inland waste of rock and wood
    In searching sunshine wild and rude
    Rose mellowed tiirough the silver gleam
    Soft as the landscape of a dream
    All motionless and dewy wet
    Tree vine and flower in shadow met
    Tiie myrtle with its snowy bloom
    Crossing the nightshades solemn gloom
    The white cecropias silver rind
    Relieved by deeper green behind
    The orange with its fruit of gold
    The lithe pauUinias verdant fold
    The passionflower with symbol holy
    Twining its tendrils long and lowly
    The rhexias dark and cassia tall
    And proudly rising over all
    The kingly palms imperial stem
    Crowned with its leafy diadem
    Starlike beneath whose sombre shade
    The fierywinged cucuUo played

    How lovely was thine aspect then
    Fair island of the Western Sea
    Lavisli of beauty even when
    Thy brntes were liappier than thy men

    For they at least were free
    Regardless of thy glorious clime

    Unmindful of tiiy soil of flowers
    The toiling negro sighed that Time

    No faster sped his hours
    For by the dewy moonlight still
    He fed the weary turning mill
    Or bent him in the chill morass
    To pluck the long and tangled gTass
    And hear above his scarworn back
    The heavy slavewiiips frequent crack
    While in his heart one evil thought
    In solitary madness wrought
    One baleful fire surviving still

    The quenching of the immortal mind
    One sterner passion of his kind
    Which even fetters could not kill
    The savage hope to deal erelong
    venseance bitterer than his wrong



    Hark to that cry  long loud and shrill
    From field and forest rock and hill
    Thrilling and horrible it rang

    Around beneath above
    The wild beast from his cavern sprang

    The wild bird from her grove
    Nor fear nor joy nor agony
    Were mingled in that midnight cry
    But like the lions growl of wrath
    When falls that hunter in his path
    Whose barbed arrow deeply set
    Is rankling in his bosom yet
    It told of hate full deep and strong
    Of vengeance kindling out of wrong
    It was as if the crimes of years
    The unrequited toil the tears
    The shame and hate which liken well
    Earths garden to the nether hell
    Had found in natures self a tongue
    On which the gathered horror hung
    As if from clitt and stream and gleu
    Burst on the startled ears of men
    That voice which rises unto God
    Solemn and stern  the cry of blood
    It ceased and all was still once more
    Save ocean chafing on his shore
    The sighing of the wind between
    The broad bananas leaves of green
    Or bough by restless plumage shook
    Or murmuring voice of mountain brook

    Brief was the silence Once again

    Pealed to the skies that frantic yell
    Glowed on the heavens a fiery stain

    And flashes rose and fell
    And painted on the bloodred sky
    Dark naked arms were tossed on high
    And round the white mans lordly hall

    Trod fierce and free the brute he made
    And those who crept along the wall
    And answered to his lightest call

    With more than spaniel dread
    The creatures of his lawless beck
    Were trampling on liis veiy neck
    And on the nightair wild and clear
    Rose womans shriek of more than fear
    For bloodied arms were round her thrown
    And dark cheeks pressed against her own

    Then injured Afric  for the shame
    Of thy own daughters vengeance came
    Full on the scornful hearts of those
    Who mocked thee in thy nameless woes
    And to thy hapless chiklren gave
    One choice  pollution or the grave

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Wliere then was he whose fiery zeal
    Had taught the trampled heart to feel
    Until despaii itself grew strong
    And vengeance fed its torch from wrong
    Now when the thunderholt is speeding
    Now when oppressions heart is bleed
    ing
    Now when the latent cnrse of Time

    Is raining down in fire and blood
    That curse which through long years of
    crime

    Has gathered drop by drop its flood
    Why strikes he not the foremost one
    Where murders sternest deeds are done

    He stood the aged palms beneath

    That shadowed oer his humble door
    Listening with halfsuspended breath
    To the wild sounds of fear and death

    Toussaint LOuverture
    What marvel that his heart beat high

    The blow for freedom had been given
    And blood had answered to the cry

    Which Earth sent up to Heaven
    What marvel that a fierce delight
    Smiled grimly oer his brow of night
    As groan and shout and bursting flame
    Told where the midnight tempest came
    With blood and fire along its van
    And death behind  he was a Man

    Yes darksouled chieftain  if the light

    Of mild Religions heavenly ray
    Unveiled not to tliy mental sight

    The lowlier and tlie purer way
    In which the Holy Sufierer trod

    Meekly amidst the sons of crime
    That calm reliance upon God

    For justice in His own good time
    That gentleness to which belongs
    Forgiveness for its many wrongs
    Even as the primal martyr kneeling
    For mercy on the evildealing
    Let not the favored white man name
    Thy stern appeal with vords of blame
    Has he not with tlie light of heaven

    Broadly around liim made the same
    Yea on liis thousand warfields striven

    And gloried in his ghastly shame
    Kneeling amidst his brotliers blood
    To ofier mockery unto God
    As if the High and Holy One
    Could smile on deeds of murder done
    As if a human sacrifice
    Were purer in His holy eyes



    Though offered up by Christian hands
    Than the foul rites of Pagan lands



    Sternly amidst his household band
    His carbine grasped within liis hand

    The white man stood prepared and still
    Waiting the shock of maddened men
    Unchained and fierce as tigers when

    The horn winds through tlieir caverned
    hill
    And one was weeping in his sight

    The sweetest flower of all the isle
    The bride who seemed but yesterniglit

    Loves fair embodied smile
    And clinging to her trembling knee
    Looked up the form of infancy
    With tearful glance in either face
    The secret of its fear to trace

    Ha  stand or die   The white mans eye

    His steady musket gleamed along
    As a tall Negro hastened nigh

    With fearless step and strong
    What ho Toussaint   A moment more
    His shadow crossed tlie lighted floor
    Away   he shouted   fly with me
    The white mans bark is on the sea
    Her sails must catch the seaward wind
    For sudden vengeance sweeps behind
    Our brethren from their graves have spoken
    The yoke is spurned the chain is broken
    On all the hills our fires are glowing
    Through all the vales red blood is flowing
    No more the mocking White shall rest
    His foot u2on the Negros breast
    No more at morn or eve shall dzip
    The warm blood from the drivers whip
    Yet though Toussaint has vengeance sworn
    For all the wrongs his race have borne
    Though for each droJ of Negro blood
    The wliite mans veins shall pour a flood
    Not all alone the sense of ill
    Around his heart is lingering still
    Nor deeper can the white man feel
    The generous warmth of grateful zeal
    Friends of the Negro  fly with me
    The path is open to the sea
    Away for life   He spoke and pressed
    The young child to his manly breast
    As headlong through the cracking cane
    Down swept the dark insurgent train
    Drunken and grim with shout and yell
    Howled through the dark like sounds from
    hell

    Far out in peace the white mans sail
    Swayed free before the sunrise gale
    Cloudlike that island hung afar

    Along the bright horizons verge
    Oer which the curse of servile war

    Rolled its red torrent surge on surge
    And he the Negro champion where

    In the fierce tumult struggled he
    Go trace him by the fiery glare
    Of dwellings in the midnight air
    The yells of triumph and despair

    The streams that crimson to the sea

    Sleep calmly iu thy dungeontomb
    Beneath Bcsantons alien Sky

    Dark Haytien  for the time shall come
    Yea even now is nigh

    When everywhere thy name shall be

    Redeemed from colors infamy

    And men shall learn to speak of thee

    As one of earths great spirits born

    In servitude and nursed in scorn

    Casting aside the weary weight

    And fetters of its low estate

    In that strong majesty of soul

    Which knows no color tongue or clime

    Which still hath spurned the base control
    Of tyrants through all time

    Far other hands than mine may wreathe

    The laurel round thy brow of death

    And speak thy praise as one whose word

    A thousand fiery spirits stirred

    Who crushed his foeman as a worm

    Whose step on human hearts fell firm

    Be mine the better task to find

    A tribute for thy lofty mind

    Amidst whose gloomy vengeance shone

    Some milder virtues all thine own

    Some gleams of feeling pure and warm

    Like sunshine on a sky of storm

    Proofs that the Negros heart retains

    Some nobleness amid its chains

    That kindness to the wronged is never

    Without its excellent reward
    Holy to humankind and ever
    Acceptable to God

    of twentytwo men and with one hundred and



    sixty negro slaves sailed from Bonny in Africa
    April IS 11 On approaching the line a terrible
    malady broke out  an obstinate disease of the
    eyeg  contagious and altogether beyond the
    resources of medicine It was aggravated by
    the scarcity of water among the slaves only
    half a wineglass per day being allowed to an
    individual and by the extreme impurity of
    the air in which they breathed By the advice
    of the physician they were brought upon deck
    occasionally  but some of the poor wretches
    locking themselves in each others arms leaped
    overboard in the hope which so universally
    prevails among them of being swiftly trans
    ported to their own homes in Africa To
    check this the captain ordered several who
    were stopped in the attempt to be shot or
    hanged before their companions The disease
    extended to the crew  and one after another
    were smitten with it until only one remained
    unaffected Yet even this dreadful condition
    did not preclude calculation  to save the ex

    And his iron lip compressed


    For one firm rood of land


    Are all the dead dogs over


    And then he laughed but only


    Growled through that matted lip

    The blind ones are no better


    For the blinded and the suliering

    Hark  from the ships dark bosom


    Night settled on the waters


    The very sounds of hell


    And on a stormy heaven


    The ringing clank of iron


    While fiercely on that lone ships track


    The maniacs short sharp yell


    The thundergust was driven


    The hoarse low curse throatstitied


    A sail    thank God a sail


    The starving infants moan


    And as the helmsman spttke


    The horror of a breaking heart


    Up through the stormy murmur


    Poured through a mothers groan


    A shout of gladness broke


    Up from that loathsome prison


    Down came the stranger vessel


    The stricken blind ones came


    Unheeding on her way


    Below had all been darkness


    So near that on the slavers deck


    Above was still the same


    Fell oft her driven spray


    Yet the holy breath of heaven


    Ho  for the love of mercy


    Was sweetly breathing there


    We re perishing and blind


    And the heated brow of fever


    A wail of litter agony


    Cooled in the soft sea air


    Came back upon the wind


    Overboard with them shipmates


    Help us  for we are stricken


    Cutlass and dirk were plied


    With blindness every one


    Fettered and blind one after one


    Ten days we ve floated fearfully


    Plunged down the vessels side


    Unnoting star or sun


    The sabre smote above


    Our ship s the slaver Leon


    Beneath the lean shark lay


    We ve but a score on board


    Waiting with wide and bloody jaw


    Our slaves are all gone over


    His piick and human prey


    Help for the love of God


    God of the earth  what cries


    On livid brows of agony


    Rang upward unto tliee


    The broad red lightning shone


    Voices of agony and blood


    But the roar of wind and thunder


    From shipdeck and from sea


    Stifled the answering groan


    The last dull plunge was heard


    Wailed from the broken waters


    The last wave cauglit its stain


    A last despairing cry


    And the un sated shark looked up


    As kindling in the stormy light


    For human hearts in vain


    The stranger ship went by


    Red glowed the western waters


    In the sunny Guadaloupe


    The setting sim was there


    A darkinilled vessel lay


    Scattering alike on wave and cloud


    With a crew who noted never


    His fiery mesh of hair


    The nightfall or the day


    Amidst a group in blindness


    The llossoin of the orange


    A solitary eye


    Was white by every stream

    And tropic leaf and flower and bird
    Were in the warm sunbeam

    And the sky was bright as ever

    And the moonlight slept as well
    On the palmtrees by the hillside

    And the streamlet of the dell
    And the glances of the Creole

    Were still as archly deep
    And her smiles as full as ever

    Of passion and of sleep

    But vain were bird and blossom

    The green earth and the sky
    And the smile of human faces

    To the slavers darkened eye
    At the breaking of the morning

    At the starlit evening time
    Oer a world of light and beauty

    Fell the blackness of his crime



    EXPOSTULATION

    Originally termed Stmisas then Fallen
    Dr Charles Follen a German patriot who
    had come to America for the freedom which was
    denied him in his native land allied himself
    mth the abolitionists and at a convention of
    delegates from all the antislavery organiza
    tions in New England held at Boston in May
    1834 was chairman of a committee to prepare
    an address to the people of Now England
    Toward the close of the address occurred the
    passage which suggested these lines

    The despotism which our fathers could
    not bear in their native country is expiring
    and tlie sword of justice in her reformed hands
    lias applied its exterminating edge to slavery
    IShall the United States  the free United
    States which could not hear the bonds of a
    king  cradle the bondage which a king is
    abolishing  Shall a Republic be less free than
    a Monarchy  Shall we in the vigor and buoy
    ancy of our manhood be less energetic in right
    eousness than a kingdom in its age    Dr
    Fallen s Address

    Genius of America   Sjiirit of our free
    institution   where art thou  How art thou
    fallen O Lucifer  son of the morning  how
    art thou fallen from Heaven  Hell from be
    neath is nuved for thee to meet thee at thy
    coming  The kings of the earth cry out to
    thee Aha  Aha  Art tliou become like unto
    us    Speech of Samuel J May

    OuK fellowcountrymen in chains
    Slaves iu a laud of light and law



    Slaves crouching on the very plains

    Where rolled the storm of Freedoms
    war

    A groan from Eutaws haunted wood
    A wail where Camdens martyrs fell

    By every shrine of patriot blood

    From Moidtries wall and Jaspers well

    By storied hill and hallowed grot

    By mossy wood and marshy gleu
    Whence rang of old the rifleshot

    And hurrying shout of Marions men
    The groan of breaking hearts is there

    The falling lash the fetters clank
    Slaves slaves are breathing in that air

    Which old De Kalb and Sumter drank

    What ho  our countrymen in chains

    The whip on womans shrinking flesh
    Our soil yet reddening with the stains

    Caught from her scourging warm and
    fresh
    What  mothers from their children riven

    What  Gods own image bought and
    sold
    Americans to market driven

    And bartered as the brute for gold

    Speak  shall their agony of prayer

    Come thrilling to our hearts in vain
    To us whose fathers scorned to bear

    The paltry menace of a chain
    To us whose boast is loud and long

    Of holy Liberty and Light
    Say shall these writhing slaves of Wrong

    Plead vainly for their plundered Right

    What  shall we send with lavish breath

    Our sympatliies across the wave
    Where Manhood on the field of death

    Strikes for his freedom or a grave
    Shall prayers go up and hymns be sung

    For Greece the Moslem fetter spurning
    And millions hail with pen and tongue

    Our light on all her altars burning

    Shall Belgium feel and gallant France

    By Vendomes pile and Schoenbruns
    wall
    And Poland gasping on her lance

    The impulse of our cheering call
    And shall the slave beneath our eye

    Clank oer our fields his hateful chain
    And toss his fettered arms on high

    And groan for Freedoms gift iu vain

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Oh say shall Prussias banner be

    A refuge for the stricken slave
    And shall the Russian serf go free

    By Baikals lake and Nevas wave
    And shall the wintrybosomed Dane

    Relax the iron hand of pride
    And bid his bondmen cast the chain

    From fettered soul and limb aside

    Shall every flap of Englands flag

    Proclaim that all around are free
    From farthest Ind to each blue crag

    That beetles oer the Western Sea
    And shall we scofi at Europes kings

    When Freedoms fire is dim with us
    And round our countrys altar clings

    The damning shade of Slaverys curse

    Go let us ask of Constantine

    To loose his grasp on Polands throat
    And beg the lord of Mahmouds line

    To spare the struggling Suliote
    Will not the scorching answer come

    From turbaned Turk and scornful Russ
    Go loose your fettered slaves at home

    Then turn and ask the like of us

    Just God  and shall we calmly rest

    The Christians scorn the heathens
    mirth
    Content to live the lingering jest

    And byword of a mocking Earth
    Shall our own glorious land retain

    That curse which Europe scorns to
    bear
    Shall our own brethren drag the chain

    Which not even Russias menials wear

    Up then in Freedoms manly part

    From graybeard eld to fiery youth
    And on the nations naked heart

    Scatter the living coals of Truth
    Up  while ye slumber deeper yet

    The sliadow of our fame is growing
    Up  while ye pause our sun may set

    In blood around our altars flowing

    Oh  rouse ye ere the storm comes forth

    The gathered wrath of God and man
    Like that wliich wasted Egypts earth

    When hail and fire above it ran
    Hear ye no warnings in the air

    Feel ye no earthquake underneath
    Up up  why will ye slumber where

    The sleeper only wakes in death



    Rise now for Freedom  not in strife

    Like that your sterner fathers saw
    The awful waste of human life

    The glory and the guilt of war
    But break the chain the yoke remove

    And smite to earth Oppressions rod
    With those mild arms of Trutli and Love

    Made mighty through the living God

    Down let the shrine of Moloch sink

    And leave no traces where it stood
    Nor longer let its idol drink

    His daily cup of human blood
    But rear another altar there

    To Truth and Love and Mercy given
    And Freedoms gift and Freedoms prayer

    Shall call an answer down from Heaven

    O Thou whose presence went before
    Our fathers in their weary way

    As with Thy chosen moved of yore
    The fire by night the cloud by day

    When from each temple of the free
    A nations song ascends to Heaven

    Most Holy Father  unto Thee

    May not our humble prayer be given

    Thy children all though hue and form
    Are varied in Thine own good will

    With Tliy own holy breathings warm
    And fashioned in Thine image still

    We thank Thee Father  hill and plain
    Around us wave their fruits once more

    And clustered vine and blossomed giain
    Are bending round each cottage door

    And peace is here  and hope and love
    Are round us as a mantle thrown

    And unto Thee supreme above
    Tlie knee of prayer is bowed alone

    But oh for those this day can bring

    As unto us no joyful thrill
    Ior tliose who under Freedoms wing

    Are bound in Slaverys fetters still

    For those to whom Thy written word
    Of light ami love is never given

    For those whose ears have never heard
    The promise and the hope of heaven

    For hroken heart and clonded mind
    Whereon uo hnman mercies fall

    Oh be Thy gracious love inclined
    Who as a Father pitiest all

    And grant O Father  that the time
    Of Earths deliverance may be near

    When every land and tongue and clime
    The message of Thy love shall hear

    When smitten as with fire from heaven
    The captives chain shall sink in dust

    And to his fettered soul be given

    THE YANKEE GIRL

    She sings by her wheel at that low cot
    tagedoor

    Which the long evening shadow is stretch
    ing before

    With a music as sweet as the music which
    seems

    Breathed softly and faint in the ear of our
    dreams

    How brilliant and mirthful the light of her

    Like a star glancing out from the blue of

    the sky
    And lightly and freely her dark tresses

    play
    Oer a brow and a bosom as lovely as they

    Who comes in his pride to that low cot
    tagedoor

    The haughty and rich to the humble and
    poor

    T is tlie great Southern planter the mas
    ter wlio waves

    His whip of dominion oer hundreds of
    slaves

    Nay Ellen for shame  Let those Yan
    kee fools spin

    Who would pass for our slaves with a
    change of their skin



    Let them toil as they will at the loom or

    the wheel
    Too stupid for shame and too vulgar to

    feel

    But thou art too lovely and precious a

    gem
    To be bound to their burdens and sullied

    by them
    For shame Illen shame cast thy bondage

    aside
    4nd away to the South as my blessing and

    pride

    Oh come where no winter thy footsteps

    can wrong
    But where flowers are blossoming all the

    year long
    Where the shade of the palmtree is over

    my home
    And the lemon and orange are white in

    their bloom

    Oh come to my home where my servants

    shall all
    Depart at thy bidding and come at thy call
    They shall heed thee as mistress with

    trembling and awe
    And each wish of thy heart shall be felt as

    a law

    Oh could ye have seen her  that pride of

    our girls
    Arise and cast back the dark wealth of her

    curls
    With a scorn in her eye which the gazer

    coidd feel
    And a glance like the sunshine that flashes

    on steel

    Go back haughty Southron  thy treas
    ures of gold

    Are dim with the blood of the hearts thou
    hast sold

    Tliy home may be lovely but round it I
    hear

    The crack of the whip and the footsteps of
    fear

    And the sky of thy South may be brighter

    than ours
    And greener thy landscapes and fairer thy

    flowers

    But dearer the blast round our mountains

    which raves
    Than the sweet summer zephyr wliich

    breathes over slaves

    Full low at thy bidding thy negroes may

    kneel
    With the iron of bondage on spirit and

    heel
    Yet know that the YaiLkee girl sooner

    would be
    In fetters with them than in freedom witlf

    THE HUNTERS OF MEN

    These lines were written when the orators of
    the American Colonization Society were de
    manding that the free blacks should be sent to
    Africa and opposing Emancipation unless ex
    patriation followed See the report of the pro
    ceedings of the society at its annual meeting
    in 1834

    Have ye heard of our himting oer moun
    tain and glen

    Through canebrake and forest  the hunt
    ing of men

    The lords of our land to this hunting have
    gone

    As the foxhunter follows the sound of the
    horn

    Hark  the cheer and the hallo  the crack
    of the whip

    And the yell of the hound as he fastens his
    grip

    All blithe are our hunters and noble their
    match

    Though hundreds are caught there are mil
    lions to catch

    So speed to their hunting oer mountain
    and glen

    Through canebrake and forest  the hunt
    ing of men

    Gay luck to our hunters  how nobly they

    ride
    In the glow of their zeal and the strength

    of their pride
    The priest with his cassock flung back on

    the wind
    Just screening the politic statesman behind
    The saint and the sinner with cursing and

    prayer



    The drunk and the sober ride merrily there
    And woman kind woman wife widow and

    maid
    For the good of the hunted is lending her

    aid
    Her foot s in the stirrup her hand on the

    rein
    How blithely she rides to the hunting of

    men

    Oh goodly and grand is our bunting to see

    In this  land of the brave and this home of
    the fiee

    Priest warrior and statesman from Geor
    gia to Maine

    All mounting the saddle all grasping the
    rein

    Right merrily hunting the black man whose
    sin

    Is the curl of his bair and the hue of his
    skin

    Woe now to the hunted who turns him at
    bay

    Will our hunters be turned from their pur
    pose and prey

    Will their hearts fail within them  their
    nerves tremble when

    All roughly they ride to the hunting of men

    Ho  alms for our hunters  all weary and

    faint
    Wax the curse of the sinner and prayer of

    the saint
    The horn is womid faintly the echoes are

    still
    Over canebrake and river and forest and

    hill
    Haste alms for our hunters  the hunted

    once more
    Have turned from their flight with their

    backs to the shore
    What right have they here in the home of

    tlie white
    Shadowed oer by our banner of Freedom

    and Right
    Ho  alms for the hunters  or never again
    Will they ride in their pomp to the hunting

    of men

    Alms alms for our hunters  why will ye de
    lay

    When their pride and their glory are melt
    ing away

    271



    Who goetli a warfare or liunting alone
    The politic statesman looks back with a

    There is doubt in his heart tuere is fear in

    his ee
    Oh haste lest that doubting and fear shall

    prevail
    And the iiead of his steed take the place of

    the tail
    Oh haste ere he leave us  for who will

    ride then
    For pleasure or gain to the hunting of

    men



    STANZAS FOR THE TIMES

    The  Times  referred to were those evil
    times of the proslavery meeting in FaneuU
    Hall Aiigust 21 183 in which a demand was
    made for the suppression of free speech lest it
    should endanger the foundation of commercial
    society

    Is this the land our fathers loved

    The freedom which they toiled to win

    Is this the soil whereon they moved
    Are these the graves they slumber in

    Are we the sons by whom are borne

    The mantles which the dead have worn

    And shall we crouch above these graves
    With craven soul and fettered lip

    Yoke in with marked and branded slaves
    And tremble at the drivers whip

    Bend to the earth our pliant knees

    And speak but as our masters please

    Shall outraged Nature cease to feel

    Shall Mercys tears no longer flow
    Shall ruffian threats of cord and steel

    The dungeons gloom the assassins blow
    Turn back the spirit roused to save
    The Truth our Country and the slave

    Of human skulls that shrine was made
    Round wliich tlie priests of Mexico

    Before their loathsome idol prayed
    Is Freedoms altar fashioned so

    And must we yield to Freedoms God

    As offering meet the negros blood

    Shall tongue be mute when deeds are
    wrouglit
    AVTiich well might shame extremest hell



    Shall freemen lock the indignant thought

    Shall Pitys bosom cease to swell
    Shall Honor bleed   shall Truth suc
    cumb
    Shall pen and press and soul be dumb

    No  by each spot of haunted ground

    Where Freedom weeps her childrens
    fall
    By Plymouths rock and Bunkers mound
    By Griswolds stained and shattered
    wall
    By Warrens ghost by Langdons shade
    By all the memories of our dead

    By their enlarging souls which burst
    The bands and fetters round them set

    By the free Pilgrim spirit nursed
    Within our inmost bosoms yet

    By all above around below

    B3 ours the indignant answer  No

    No  guided by our countrys laws

    For truth and right and suffering man

    Be ours to strive in Freedoms cause
    As Christians may as freemen can

    Still pouring on unwilling ears

    That truth oppression only fears

    What  shall we guard our neighbor still
    While woman shrieks beneath his rod

    And while he tramples down at will
    The image of a common God

    Shall watch and ward be round him set

    Of Northern nerve aiul bayonet

    And sliall we know and share with him
    The danger and the growing shame

    And see our Freedoms light grow dim
    Which should have filled the world with
    flame

    And writhing feel whereer we turn

    A worlds reproach around us burn

    Is t not enough tliat this is borne

    And asks our haughty neighbor more
    Must fetters which his slaves have worn

    Clank round the Yankee farmers door
    Must he be told beside his plough
    What he must speak and when and how

    Must he be told his freedom stands
    On Slaverys dark foundations strong

    On breaking hearts and fettered hands
    On robbery and crime and wrong

    False foul profane  Go teach as well
    Of holy Truth from Falsehood born

    Of Heaven refreshed by airs from Hell
    Of Virtue in the arms of Vice
    Of Demons planting Paradise

    Ye shall not hear the truth the less

    CLERICAL OPPRESSORS

    In the report of the celebrated proslavery
    meeting in Charleston S C  on the 4th of the
    ninth month 1835 published in the Courier of
    that city it is stated   The clergy of all de
    nominations attended in a body lending their
    sanction to the proceedings and adding by
    their presence to the impressive character of
    the scene

    Just God  and these are they
    Who minister at thine altar God of Right
    Men who their hands with prayer and bless
    ing lay

    On Israels Ark of light

    What  preach and kidnap men
    Give thanks and rob thy owai afflicted

    poor
    Talk of tliy glorious liberty and then

    Bolt hard the captives door

    What  servants of thy own
    Merciful Son who came to seek and save
    The homeless and the outcast fettering
    down

    The tasked and plundered slave

    Pilate and Herod friends
    Chief priests and rulers as of old com
    bine
    Just God and holy  is that church which
    lends
    Strength to the spoiler thine

    Paid hypocrites who turn
    Judgment aside and rob the Holy Book



    Of those high words of truth which search
    and burn
    In warning and rebuke

    Feed fat ye locusts feed
    And in your tasselled pulpits thank the

    Lord
    That from the toiling bondmans utter need

    Ye pile your own full board

    How long O Lord  how long
    Shall such a priesthood barter truth away
    And in Thy name for robbery and wrong

    At Thy own altars pray

    Is not Thy hand stretched forth
    Visibly in the heavens to awe and smite
    Shall not the living God of all the earth

    And heaven above do right

    Woe then to all who grind
    Their brethren of a common Father down
    To all who plunder from the immortal
    mind

    Its bright and glorious crown

    Woe to the priesthood  woe
    To those whose hire is with the price of

    blood
    Perverting darkening changing as they

    go
    The searching truths of God

    Their glory and their might
    Shall perish  and their very names shall

    be
    Vile before all the people in the light

    Of a worlds liberty

    Oh speed the moment on
    Wlien Wrong shall cease and Liberty and

    Love

    Mr Pinckneys resolutions were in brief that
    Congress had no authority to interfere in any
    way with slavery in the States  that it ought
    not to interfere with it in the District of Co
    lumbia and that all resolutions to that end
    should be laid on the table without printing
    Mr Calhouns bill made it a penal oftence for
    postmasters in any State District or Territory
    knowingly to deliver to any person whatever
    any pamphlet newspaper handbill or other
    printed paper or pictorial representation touch
    ing the subject of slavery where by the laws
    of the said State District or Territory their
    circulation was prohibited Originally en

    Stoops the strong manhood of our soiUs
    so low
    That Mammons lure or Partys wile can

    Now when our land to ruins brink is
    verging
    In Gods name let us speak while there
    is time
    Now when the padlocks for our lips are

    Silence is crime

    What  shall we henceforth humbly ask
    as favors
    Rights all our own  In madness shall
    we barter
    For treacherous peace the freedom Nature
    gave us

    God and our charter

    Here shall the statesman forge his human
    fetters
    Here the false jurist human rights deny
    And in the church their proud and skilled

    From valleys where her slumbering

    From her blue rivers and her welling

    neath the hammer
    Rings the red steel

    From each and all if God hath not forsaken

    Our land and left us to an evil choice
    Loud as the summer thunderbolt shall
    waken

    A Peoples voice

    Startling and stern  the Northern winds
    shall bear it
    Over Potomacs to St Marys wave
    And buried Freedom shall awake to hear it
    Within her grave

    Oh let that voice go forth  The bond
    man sighing
    By Santees wave in Mississippis cane
    Shall feel the hope within his bosom dying
    Revive again

    Let it go forth  The millisns who are
    gazing
    Sadly upon us from afar shall smile

    TO THE MEMORY OF THOMAS
    SHIPLEY

    Thomas Shipley of Philadelphia was a life
    long Christian philanthropist and advocate
    of emancipation At his funeral thousands of
    colored people came to take their last look at
    their friend and protector He died Septem
    ber 17 1836

    Gone to thy Heavenly Fathers rest

    The flowers of Eden round thee blow
    ings
    And on thine ear the murmurs blest

    Of Siloas waters softly flowing
    Beneath that Tree of Life which gives
    To all the earth its healing leaves
    In the white robe of angels clad

    And wandering by that sacred river
    Whose streams of holiness make glad

    The city of our God forever

    Gentlest of spirits  not for thee

    Our tears are shed our sighs are given

    Why mourn to know thou art a free
    Partaker of the joys of heaven

    Finished thy work and kept thy faith

    In Christian firmness unto death

    And beautiful as sky and earth



    When autumns sun is downward goino
    The blessed memory of thy worth

    Around thy place of slumber glowing

    But woe for us  who linger still

    With feebler strength and hearts less
    lowly
    And minds less steadfast to the will

    Of Him whose every work is holy
    For not like thine is crucified
    The spirit of our human pride
    And at the bondmans tale of woe

    And for the outcast and forsaken
    Not warm like thine but cold and slow

    Our weaker sympathies awaken

    Darkly upon our struggling way

    The storm of human hate is sweeping
    Hiuited and branded and a prey

    Our watch amidst the darkness keeping
    Oh for that hidden strength which can
    Nerve unto death the inner man
    Oh for thy spirit tried and true

    And constant in the hour of trial
    Prepared to suffer or to do

    In meekness and in selfdenial

    Oh for that spirit meek and mild

    Derided spurned yet uncomplaining
    By man deserted and reviled

    Yet faithful to its trust remaining
    Still prompt and resolute to save
    From scourge and chain the hunted slave
    Unwavering in the Truths defence

    Even where the fires of Hate were burn
    ing
    The unquailing eye of innocence

    Alone upon the oppressor turning

    O loved of thousands  to thy grave

    Sorrowing of heart thy brethren bore
    thee
    The poor man and the rescued slave

    Wept as the broken earth closed oer
    thee
    And grateful tears like summer rain
    Quickened its dying grass again
    And there as to some pilgrimshrine

    Shall come the outcast and the lowly
    Of gentle deeds and words of thine

    Recalling memories sweet and holy

    Oh for the death the righteous die
    An end like autumns day declining

    Ou liunian hearts as on the sky

    With holier tenderer beauty shining

    As to the parting soul were given

    The radiance of an opening heaven

    As if that pure and blessed light
    From off the Eternal altar flowing

    Were bathing in its upward flight
    The spirit to its worship going



    THE MORAL WARFARE

    When Freedom on her natal day
    Within her warrocked cradle lay
    An iron race around her stood
    Baptized her infant brow in blood
    And through the storm which round her

    swept
    Their constant avd and watching kept

    Then where our quiet herds repose
    The roar of baleful battle rose
    And brethren of a common tongue
    To mortal strife as tigers sprung
    And every gift on Freedoms shrine
    Was man for beast and blood for wine

    Our fathers to their graves have gone
    Their strife is past their triumph won
    But sterner trials wait the race
    Which rises in their honored place
    A moral warfare with the crime
    And folly of an evil time

    So let it be In Gods own might

    We gird us for the coming fight

    And strong in Him whose cause is ours

    In conflict with unholy powers

    We grasp the weapons He has given

    The Light and Truth and Love of Heaven



    RITNER

    Written on reading the Message of Governor
    Ritner of Pennsylvania 1836 The fact re
    dounds to the credit and serves to perpetuate
    the memory of the independent farmer and
    highsouled statesman that he alone of all the
    Governors of the Union in I806 met the insulting
    demands and menaces of the South in a manner
    beconiing a freeman and hater of Slavery in
    his message to the Legislature of Pennsylvania
    Originally entitled Lines



    Thank God for the token  one lip is still

    free
    One spirit untrammelled unbending one

    knee

    and firm
    Erect when the multitude bends to the

    storm
    When traitors to Freedom and Honor

    and God
    Are bowed at an Idol polluted with blood
    When the recreant North has forgotten her

    trust
    And the lip of her honor is low in the dust
    Thank God that one arm from the shackle

    has broken
    Thank God that one man as a freeman has

    spoken

    Oer thy crags Alleghany a blast has been

    blown
    Down thy tide Susquehanna the murmur

    has gone
    To the land of the South of the charter and

    chain
    Of Liberty sweetened with Slaverys pain
    Where the cant of Democracy dwells on the

    lips
    Of the forgers of fetters and wielders of

    whips
    Where  chivalric  honor means really no

    more
    Than scourging of women and robbing the

    poor
    Where the Moloch of Slavery sitteth on

    high
    And the words which he utters are  Wor
    ship or die

    Right onward oh speed it  Wherever the

    blood
    Of the wronged and the guiltless is crying

    to God
    Wherever a slave in his fetters is pining
    Wherever the lash of the driver is twining
    Wherever from kindred torn rudely apart
    Comes the sorrowful wail of the broken of

    heart
    Wherever the shackles of tyranny bind
    In silence and darkness the God given

    mind
    There God speed it onward  its truth will

    be felt
    The bonds sliall be loosened the iron shall

    Who haters of fraud give to labor its due
    Whose fathers of old sang in concert

    with thine
    On the banks of Swetara the songs of the

    Rhine
    The Germanborn pilgrims who first dared

    to brave
    The scorn of the proud in the cause of the

    slave
    Will the sons of such men yield the lords

    of the South



    One brow for the brand for the padlock

    one mouth
    They cater to tyrants  They rivet the

    chain
    Which their fathers smote off on the negro

    again

    No never  one voice like the sound in the

    cloud
    When the roar of the storm waxes loud

    and more lovid
    Wherever the foot of the freeman hath

    piessed
    From the Delawares marge to the Lake

    of the West
    On the Southgoing breezes shall deepen

    and grow
    Till the land it sweeps over shall tremble

    below
    The voice of a people uprisen awake
    Pennsylvanias watchword with Freedom

    THE PASTORAL LETTER

    The General Association of Congiegational
    ministers in Massachusetts met at Brookfield
    June 21 1837 and issued a Pastoral Letter to
    the churches iinder its care The immediate
    occasion of it was the profound sensation pro
    duced by the iecent public lecture in Massa
    chusetts by Angelina and Sarah Grimk two
    noble women from South Carolina who bore
    their testimony against slavery The Letter
    demanded that  the perplexed and agitating
    subjects which are now common amongst us
    should not be forced upon any chiuch
    as matters for debate at the hazard of aliena
    tion and division and called attention to the
    dangers now seeming  to threaten the female
    chaiacter with widespread and permanent in
    jury

    So this is all  the utmost reach

    Of priestly power the mind to fetter
    When laymen think when women preach

    A war of words a  Pastoral Letter
    Now shame upon ye parish Popes

    Was it thus with those your predecessors
    Who sealed with racks and fire and ropes

    Their lovingkindness to transgressors



    THE PASTORAL LETTER



    277



    A  Pastoral Letter grave aud dull

    Alas  iu hoof aud horns aud features
    How differeut is your Brookfield bull

    From him who bellows from St Peters
    Your pastoral rights aud powers from harm

    Thiuk ye can words alone preserve them
    Your wiser fathers taught the arm

    Aud sword of temporal power to serve
    them

    Oh glorious days when Church and State

    Were wedded by your spiritual fathers
    And on submissive shoulders sat

    Your Wilsons and your Cotton Mathers
    No vile itinerant then could mar

    The beauty of your tranquil Zion
    But at his peril of the scar

    Of hangmans whip aud brandiugiron

    Then wholesome laws relieved the Church

    Of heretic and mischiefmaker
    And priest and bailiff joined in search

    By turns of Papist witch and Quaker
    The stocks were at each churchs door

    The gallows stood on Boston Common
    A Papists ears the pillory bore

    The gallowsrope a Quaker woman

    Your fathers dealt not as ye deal

    With  nonprofessing  frantic teachers
    They bored the tongue with redhot steel

    Aud flayed the backs of  female preach
    ers
    Old Hampton had her fields a tongue

    And Salems streets could tell their story
    Of fainting woman dragged along

    Gashed by the whip accursed aud gory

    And will ye ask me why this taunt

    Of memories sacred from the scorner
    And wliy with reckless baud I plant

    A nettle on the graves ye honor
    Not to reproach New Englands dead

    This record from tlie past I summon
    Of manhood to the scaffold led

    Aud suffering and heroic woman

    No for yourselves alone I turn

    The pages of intolerance over
    That in their spirit dark and stern

    Ye haply may your own discover
    For if ye claim the  pastoral right

    To silence Freedoms voice of warning
    And from your precincts shut the light

    Of Freedoms day around ye dawning



    If when an earthquake voice of power
    Aud signs in earth and heaven are show
    ing

    That forth in its appointed hour
    The Spirit of the Lord is going

    Aud with that Spirit Freedoms light
    On kindred tongue and people break

    Whose slumbering millions at the sight
    In glory aud in strength are Avaking

    When for the sighing of the poor

    And for the needy God hath risen
    And chains are breaking aud a door

    Is opening for the souls in prison
    If then ye woidd with puny hands

    Arrest the very work of Heaven
    And bind anew the evil bands

    Which Gods right arm of power hath
    riven

    What marvel that iu many a mind

    Those darker deeds of bigot madness
    Are closely with your own combined

    Yet  less in anger than in sadness
    What marvel if the people learu

    To claim the right of free opinion
    What marvel if at times they spurn

    The ancient yoke of your dominion

    A glorious remnant linger yet

    Whose lips are wet at Freedoms foun
    tains
    The coming of whose welcome feet

    Is beautifid upon our naountains
    Men who the gospel tidings bring

    Of Liberty and Love forever
    Whose joy is an abiding spring

    Whose peace is as a gentle river

    But ye who scorn the thrilling tale

    Of Carolinas highsouled daughters
    Which echoes here the mournful wail

    Of sorrow from Edistos waters
    Close while ye may the public ear

    With malice vex with slander wound
    them
    The pure aud good shall throng to hear

    And tried and manly hearts surround
    them

    Oh ever may the power which led
    Their way to such a fiery trial

    Aud strengthened womanhood to tread
    The winepress of such selfdenial

    Be round them in an evil laud

    With wisdom and with strength from
    Heaven
    With Miriams voice and Judiths hand

    And Deborahs soug for triumph given

    And what are ye who strive with God

    Against the ark of His salvation
    Moved by the breath of prayer abroad

    With blessings for a dying nation
    What but the stubble and the hay

    To perish even as flax consuming
    With all that bars His glorious way

    Before the brightness of His coming

    And thou sad Angel who so long

    Hast waited for the glorious token
    That Earth from all her bonds of wrong

    To liberty and light has broken
    Angel of Freedom  soon to thee

    The sounding trumpet shall be given
    And over Earths full jubilee

    Shall deeper joy be felt in Heaven

    O Holy Father  just and true

    Are all Thy works and words and ways
    And unto Thee alone are due

    Thanksgiving and eternal praise
    As children of Thy gracious care

    We veil the eye we bend the knee
    With broken words of praise and prayer

    Father and God we come to Thee

    For Thou hast heard O God of Right

    The sighing of the island slave
    And stretched for him the arm of might

    Not shortened that it could not save
    The laborer sits beneath his vine

    The shackled soul and hand are free
    Thanksgiving  for the work is Thine

    Praise  for the blessing is of Thee

    And oh we feel Thy presence here

    Thy awful arm in judgment bare
    Thine eye hath seen the bondmans tear
    Thine ear hath heard the bondmans
    prayer



    Praise  for tlie pride of man is low
    The counsels of the wise are naught

    The fountains of repentance flow

    What hath our God in mercy wrought

    Speed on Thy work Lord God of Hosts

    And when the bondmans chain is riven
    And swells from all our guilty coasts

    The anthem of the free to Heaven
    Oh not to those whom Thou hast led

    As with Thy cloud and fire before
    But unto Thee in fear and dread

    Be praise and glory evermore

    Theie no mothers ear can hear them
    Never when the torturing lash
    Seams their back with many a gash
    Shall a mothers kindness bless them

    From the fields at niglit they go
    Faint with toil and racked with pain
    To their cheerless homes again
    There no brothers voice shall greet them
    There no fathers welcome meet them

    From the tree whose shadow lay

    On their cliildhoods place of play

    From the cool spring where they drank

    Rock and hill and rivulet bank

    From the solemn house of prayer

    And the holy counsels there

    Gone gone  sold and gone
    To the riceswamp dank and lone
    From Virginias hills and waters
    Woe is me my stolen daughters

    Gone gone  sold and gone
    To the riceswamp dank and lone
    Toiling through the weary day
    And at night the spoilers prey
    Oh that they had earlier died
    Sleeping calmly side by side
    Where the tyrants power is oer
    And the fetter galls no more

    Gone gone  sold and gone
    To the riceswamp dank and lone
    From Virginias hills and waters
    Woe is me my stolen daughters

    Gone gone  sold and gone
    To the riceswamp dank and lone
    By the holy love He beareth
    By the bruised reed He spareth
    Oh may He to whom aloue
    All their cruel wrongs are known
    Still their hope and refuge prove
    With a more than mothers love
    Gone gone  sold and gone
    To the riceswamp dank and lone
    From Virginias hills and waters
    Woe is me my stolen daughters



    PENNSYLVANIA HALL

    Read at the dedication of Pennsylvania Hall
    Philadelphia May 1 I80S The building was
    erected by an association of gentlemen irre
    spective of sect or party  that the citizens of
    Pliiladelphia should possess a room wherein
    the principl s of Liberty and Equality of Civil
    Rights could be freely discussed and the evils
    of slavery fearlessly portrayed On the even
    ing of the 17th it was burned by a mob de



    stroying the office of the Pennsylvania Free
    man of which I was editor and with it my
    books and papers

    Not with the splendors of the days of old
    The spoil of nations and barbaric gold
    No weapons wrested from the lields of

    blood
    Where dark and stern the unyielding Ro
    man stood
    And the proud eagles of his cohorts saw
    A world warwasted crouching to his law
    Nor blazoned car nor banners floating gay
    Like those which swept along the Appiaa

    Way
    When to the welcome of imperial Rome
    The victor warrior came in triumph home
    And trumpet peal and shoutings wild and

    high
    Stirred the blue quiet of the Italian sky
    But calm and giateful prayerful and sin
    cere
    As Christian freemen only gathering here
    We detlicate our fair and lofty Hall
    Pillar and arch entablature and wall
    As Virtues shrine as Libertys abode
    Sacred to Freedom and to Freedoms God
    Far statelier Halls ueath brighter skies

    than these
    Stood darkly mirrored in the gean seas
    Pillar and shrine and lifelike statues seen
    Graceful and pure the marble shafts be
    tween
    Where glorious Athens from her rocky hill
    Saw Art and Beauty subject to her will
    Aud the chaste temple and the classic

    grove
    The hall of sages and the bowers of love
    Arch fane and column graced the shores

    and gave
    Their shadows to the blue Saronic wave
    And statelier rose on Tibers winding side
    The Pantheons dome the Coliseums pride
    The Capitol whose arches backward flung
    The deep clear cadence of the Roman

    tongue
    Whence stern decrees lilve words of fate

    went forth
    To the awed nations of a conquered earth
    Where the proud Ciesars in their glory

    came
    And Brutus lightened from his lips of

    flame
    Yet in the porches of Athenas halls
    And in the shadow of her stately walls

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Lurked the sad bondman and his tears of

    woe
    Wet the cold marble with unheeded flow
    And fetters clanked beneath the silver

    dome
    Of the jjroud Pantheon of imperious Rome
    Oh not for him the chained and stricken

    slave
    By Tibers shore or blue iEginas wave
    In the thronged forum or the sages seat
    The bold lip pleaded and the warm heart

    beat
    No soul of sorrow melted at his pain
    No tear of pity rusted on his chain

    But this fair Hall to Truth and Freedom

    given
    Pledged to the Right before all Earth and

    Heaven
    A free arena for the strife of mind
    To caste or sect or color unconfined
    Shall thrill with echoes such as neer of

    old
    From Roman hall or Grecian temple rolled
    Thoughts shall find utterance such as never

    yet
    The Propylea or the Forum met
    Beneath its roof no gladiators strife
    Shall win applauses with the waste of life
    No lordly lictor urge the barbarous game
    No wanton Lais glory in her shame
    But here the tear of sympathy shall flow
    As the ear listens to the tale of woe
    Here in stern judgment of the oppressors

    wrong
    Shall strong rebukings thrill on Freedoms

    tongue
    No partial justice hold th imequal scale
    No pride of caste a brothers rights assail
    No tyrants mandates echo from this wall
    Holy to Freedom and the Rights of All
    But a fair field where mind may close with

    mind
    Free as the sunshine and the chainless wind
    Where the high trust is fixed on Truth

    alone
    And bonds and fetters from the soul are

    thrown
    Where wealth and rank and worldly pomp

    and might
    Yield to the presence of the True and Right

    And fitting is it that this Hall should stand
    Where Pennsylvanias Foiuider led his band
    From thy blue waters Delaware   to press



    The virgin verdure of the wilderness

    Here where all Europe with amazement
    saw

    The souls high freedom trammelled by no
    law

    Here where the fierce and warlike forest
    men

    Gathered in peace aroimd the home of
    Penn

    Awed by the weapons Love alone had given

    Drawn from the holy armory of Heaven

    Where Natures voice against the bondmans
    wrong

    First found an earnest aud indignant
    tongue

    Where Lays bold message to the proud
    was borne

    And Keiths rebuke and Franklins manly
    scorn

    Fitting it is that here where Freedom first

    From her fair feet shook off the Old Worlds
    dust

    Spread her white pinions to our AVestern
    blast

    And her free tresses to our sunshine cast

    One Hall should rise redeemed from Sla
    verys ban

    One Temple sacred to the Rights of Man

    Oh  if the spirits of the parted come
    Visiting angels to their olden home
    If the dead fathers of the laud look forth
    From their fair dwellings to the things of

    earth
    Is it a dream that with their eyes of love
    They gaze now on us from the bowers above
    Lays ardent soul aud Benezet the mild
    Steadfast in faith yet gentle as a child
    Meekhearted Woolman and that brother
    band
    The sorrowing exiles from their  Father
    land
    Leaving their homes in Krieshiems bowers

    of vine
    And the blue beauty of their glorious Rhine
    To seek amidst our solemn depths of wood
    Freedom from man and holy peace with

    God
    Who first of all their testimonial gave
    Against the oppressor for the outcast slave
    Is it a dream that such as these look down
    And with their blessing our rejoicings

    crown
    Let us rejoice that while the pulpits door
    Is barred against the pleaders for the poor



    THE NEW YEAR



    While the Church wrangling upon points

    of faith
    Forgets her bondmen suffering unto death
    While crafty Traffic and the lust of Gain
    Unite to forge Oppressions triple chain
    One door is open and one Temple free
    As a restingplace for hunted Liberty
    Where men may speak unshackled and

    unawed
    High words of Truth for Freedom and for

    God
    And when that truth its perfect work hath

    done
    And rich with blessings oer our land hath

    gone
    When not a slave beneath his yoke shall

    pine
    From broad Potomac to the far Sabine
    When unto angel lips at last is given
    The silver trump of Jubilee in Heaven
    And from Virginias plains Kentuckys

    shades
    And through the dim Floridian everglades
    Rises to meet that angeltrumpets sound
    The voice of millions from their chains un
    bound
    Then though this Hall be crumbling in de
    cay
    Its strong walls blending with the common

    clay
    Yet round the ruins of its strength shall

    stand
    The best and noblest of a ransomed land
    Pilgrims like these who throng around the

    shrine
    Of Mecca or of holy Palestine
    A prouder glory shall that ruin own
    Than that which lingers round the Parthe
    non
    Here shall the child of after years be taught
    The works of Freedom which his fathers

    wrought
    Told of the trials of the present hour
    Our weary strife with prejudice and power
    How the high errand quickened womans

    soul
    And touched her lip as with a living coal
    How Freedoms martyrs kept their lofty

    faith
    True and unwavering unto bonds and death
    The pencils art shall sketch the ruined

    Hall
    The Muses garland crown its aged wall
    And Historys pen for after times record
    Its consecration unto Freedoms God



    THE NEW YEAR

    Addressed to the Patrons of the Pennsyivunia
    Freeman

    The wave is breaking on the shore
    The echo fading from the chime

    Again the shadow moveth oer
    The dialplate of time

    O seerseen Angel  waiting now
    With weary feet on sea and shore

    Impatient for the last dread vow
    That time shall be no more

    Once more across thy sleepless eye
    The semblance of a smile has passed

    The year departing leaves more nigli
    Times fearfullest and last

    Oh in that dying year hath been
    The sum of all since time began

    The birth and death the joy and pain
    Of Nature and of Man

    Spring with her change of sun and shower
    And streams released from Winters
    chain

    And bursting bud and opening flower
    And greenly growing grain

    And Suinmers shade and sunshine warm
    And rainbows oer her hilltops bowed

    And voices in her rising storm
    God speaking from His cloud

    And Autumns fruits and clustering sheaves
    And soft warm days of golden light

    The glory of her forest leaves
    And harvestmoon at night

    And Winter with her leafless grove

    And prisoned stream and drifting snow

    The brilliance of her heaven above
    And of her earth below

    And man in whom an angels mind
    With earths low instincts finds abode

    The highest of the links which bind
    Brute nature to her God

    His infant eye hath seen the light

    His childhoods merriest laughter rung

    And active sports to manlier might
    The nerves of boyhood strung



    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    And quiet love and passions fires

    Have soothed or burned in manhoods
    breast

    And lofty aims and low desires
    By turns disturbed his rest

    The wailing of the newlyborn

    Has mingled with the funeral knell
    And oer the dyings ear has gone
    The merry marriagebell

    And Wealth has filled his halls with mirth
    While Want in many a humble shed

    Toiled shivering by her cheerless hearth
    The livelong night for bread

    And woise than all the human slave
    The sport of lust and pride and scorn

    Plucked off the crown his Maker gave
    His regal manhood gone

    Oh still my country  oer thy plains
    Blackened with slaverys blight and ban

    That human chattel drags his chains
    An uncreated man

    And still whereer to sun and breeze
    My country is tiiy Hag unrolled

    With scorn the gazing stranger sees
    A stain on every fold

    Oh tear the gorgeous emblem down

    It gathers scorn from every eye
    And despots smile and good men frown

    Wheneer it passes by

    Shame  shame  its starry splendors glow
    Above the slavers loathsome jail

    Its folds are ruffling even now
    His crimson flag of sale

    Still round our countrys proudest hall
    The trade in human flesh is driven

    And at each careless hammerfall
    A human heart is riven

    And tliis too sanctioned by the men
    Vested with power to shield the right

    And throw each vile and robber den
    Wide open to the light

    Yet shame upon them  there they sit
    Men of the North subdued and still

    Meek pliant poltroons only fit
    To work a masters will



    Sold bargained oft for Southern votes
    A passive herd of Northern mules

    Just braying through their purchased
    throats
    Whateer their owner rules

    And he the basest of the base

    The vilest of the vile whose name

    Embalmed in infinite disgrace
    Is deathless in its shame

    A tool to bolt the peoples door

    Against the people clamoring there

    An ass to trample on their floor
    A peoples right of jjrayer

    Nailed to his selfmade gibbet fast
    Selfpilloried to the public view

    A mark for every passing blast
    Of scorn to whistle through

    There let him hang and hear the boast
    Of Southrons oer their pliant tool

    A new Stylites on his post
    Sacred to ridicule

    Look we at home  our noble hall
    To Freedoms lioly purjose given

    Now rears its black and ruined wall
    Beneath the wintry heaven

    Telling the story of its doom

    The fiendish mob the prostrate law

    The fieiy jet through midnights gloom
    Our gazing thousands saw

    Look to our State  the poor mans right
    Torn from him  and the sons of those

    Whose blood in Freedoms sternest fight
    Sjjrinkled the Jeisey snows

    Outlawed within the land of Penn

    Tliat Slaverys guilty fears might cease

    And those whom God created men
    Toil on as brutes in peace

    Yet oer the blackness of the storm
    A bow of romise bends on high

    And gleams of sunshine soft and warm
    Break through our clouded sky

    East West and North the shout is heard
    Of freemen rising for the right

    Each valley hatli its rallying word
    Each hill its signal liffht



    THE RELIC



    283



    Oer Massachusetts rocks of gray

    The strengthening light of freedom
    shines

    Rhode Islands Narragansett Bay
    And Vermonts snowhung pines

    From Hudsons frowning palisades

    To Alleghanys laurelled crest
    Oer lakes and prairies streams and glades

    It shines upon the West

    Speed on the light to those who dwell
    In Slaverys land of woe and sin

    And through the blackness of that Hell
    Let Heavens own light break in

    So shall the Southern conscience quake
    Before that light poured full aud strong

    So shall the Southern heart awake
    To all the bondmans wrong

    And from that rich and sunny land
    The song of grateful millions rise

    Like that of Israels ransomed band
    Beneath Arabias skies

    And all who now are bound beneath
    Our banners shade our eagles wing

    From Slaverys night of moral death
    To light and life shall spring

    Broken the bondmans chain and gone
    The masters guilt and hate and fear

    And unto both alike shall dawn
    A New and Happy Year

    THE RELIC

    Written on receiving a cane wroiight from a
    fragment of the woodwork of Pennsylvania
    Hall which the fire had spared

    Token of friendship true and tried
    From one whose fiery heart of youth

    With mine has beaten side by side
    For Liberty and Truth

    With honest pride the gift I take

    And prize it for the givers sake

    But not alone because it tells

    Of generous hand and heart sincere

    Around that gift of friendship dwells
    A memory doubly dear

    Earths noblest aim mans holiest thought

    With that memorial frail inwrought



    Pure thoughts and sweet like flowers unfold
    And precious memories round it cliug

    Even as the Prophets rod of old
    In beauty blossoming

    And buds of feeling pure and good

    Spring from its cold unconscious wood

    Relic of Freedoms shrine  a brand
    Plucked from its burning  let it be

    Dear as a jewel from the hand
    Of a lost friend to me

    Flower of a perished garland left

    Of life and beauty unbereft

    Oh if the young enthusiast bears
    Oer weary waste and sea the stone

    Which crumbled from the Forums stairs
    Or round the Parthenon

    Or olivebough from some wild tree

    Hung over old Thermopylse

    If leaflets from some heros tomb

    Or mosswreath torn from ruins hoary

    Or faded flowers wliose sisters bloom
    On fields renowned in story

    Or fragment from the Alhambras crest

    Or the gray rock by Druids blessed

    Sad Erins shamrock greenly growing
    Where Freedom led her stalwart kern

    Or Scotias  rough bur thistle  blowing
    On Bruces Bannockburn

    Or Runnymedes wild English rose

    Or lichen plucked from Sempachs snows

    If it be true that things like these

    To heart and eye bright visions bring

    Shall not far holier memories
    To this memorial cling

    Which needs no mellowing mist of time

    To hide the crimson stains of crime

    Wreck of a temple unprofaned

    Of courts where Peace with Freedom trod
    Lifting on high with hands unstained

    Thanksgiving unto God
    Where Mercys voice of love was jleading
    For human hearts in bondage bleeding

    Where midst the sound of rushing feet
    And curses on the nightair flung

    That pleading voice rose calm and sveet
    From womans earnest tongue

    And Riot turned his scowling glance

    Awed from her tranquil countenance



    284



    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    That temjile uow in ruin lies

    The firestain on its shattered wall
    And open to the changing skies

    Its black and roofless hall
    It stands before a nations sight
    A gravestone over buried Right

    But from that ruin as of old

    The firescorched stones themselves are
    crying
    And from their ashes white and cold

    Its timbers are replying
    A voice which slavery cannot kill
    Speaks from the crumbling arches still

    And even this relic from thy shrine

    O holy Freedom  hath to me
    A potent power a voice and sign

    To testify of thee
    And grasping it methinks I feel
    A deeper faith a stronger zeal

    And not unlike that mystic rod

    Of old stretched oer the Egyptian wave
    Which opened in the strength of God

    A pathway for the slave
    It yet may point the bondmans way
    And tmn the spoiler from his prey



    THE WORLDS CONVENTION

    OF THE FRIENDS OF EMANCIPATION
    HELD IN LONDON IN 1 840

    Joseph Stnrge the founder of the British
    and Foreign Anti Slavery Society proposed
    the calling of a worlds antislavery convention
    and the proposal was promptly seconded by
    the American AntiSlavery Society The call
    was adressed to   friends of the slave of every
    nation and of every clime

    Yes let them gather  Summon forth
    The pledged philanthropy of Earth
    From every land whose liills have heard
    The bugle blast of Freedom wakiug
    Or shrieking of her symbolbird

    From out his cloudy eyrie breaking
    Where Justice hath one worshipper
    Or truth one altar built to her
    Whereer a human eye is weeping

    Oer wrongs which Earths sad children
    know
    Whereer a single heart is keeping

    Its prayerfid watch with human woe



    Thence let them come and greet each

    other
    And know in each a friend and brother

    Yes let them come  from each green vale

    Where Englands old baronial halls
    Still bear upon their storied walls
    The grim crusaders rusted mail
    Battered by Paynim spear and brand
    On Maltas rock or Syrias sand
    And mouldering pennonstaves once set

    Within the soil of Palestine
    By Jordan and Gennesaret

    Or borne with Englands battle line
    Oer Acres shattered turrets stooping
    Or midst the camp their banners drooping

    With dews from hallowed Hermon wet
    A holier summons now is given
    Than that gray hermits voice of old
    Which unto all the winds of heaven

    The banners of the Cross unrolled
    Not for the longdeserted shrine

    Not for the didl unconscious sod
    Which tells not by one lingering sign

    That there the hope of Israel trod
    But for that truth for which alone

    In pilgrim eyes are sanctified
    The garden moss the mountain stone
    Whereon His holy sandals pressed
    The fountain which His lip hath blessed
    Whateer hath touched His garments hem

    At Bethany or Bethlehem

    Or Jordans riverside
    For Freedom in the name of Him

    Who came to raise Earths drooping poor
    To break the chain from every limb
    The bolt from every prison door
    For these oer all the earth hath passed
    An everdeepening trumpet blast
    As if an angels breath had lent
    Its vigor to the instrument

    And Wales from Snowdens mountain wall
    Shall startle at that thrilling call

    As if she heard her bards again
    And Erins  harp on Taras wall

    Give out its ancient strain
    Mirthful and sweet yet sad withal

    The melody which Erin loves
    When oer that harp mid bursts of glad
    ness
    And slogan cries and lykewake sadness

    The hand of her OConnell moves
    Scotland from lake and tarn and rill
    And mountain hold and heathery hill



    THE WORLDS CONVENTION



    28



    Shall catch and echo back the note
    As if she heard upon the air
    Once more her Cameronians prayer

    And song of Freedom Hoat
    And cheering echoes shall reply
    From each remote dependency
    Where Britains mighty sway is known
    In tropic sea or frozen zone
    Whereer her sunset flag is furling
    Or morning gunfires smoke is curling
    From Indian Bengals groves of palm
    And rosy fields and gales of balm
    Where Eastern pomp and power are rolled
    Through regal Avas gates of gold
    And from the lakes and ancient woods
    And dim Canadian solitudes
    Whence sternly from her rocky throne
    Queen of the North Quebec looks down
    And from those bright and ransoined Isles
    Where all unwonted Freedom smiles
    And the dark laborer still retains I

    The scar of slaverys broken chains  j

    From the hoar Alps Avhich sentinel
    The gateways of the land of Tell
    Where mornings keen and earliest glance

    On Juras rocky wall is thrown
    And from the olive bowers of France

    And vine groves garlanding the Rhone
    Friends of the Blacks as true and tried
    As those who stood by Oges side
    And heard the Haytiens tale of wrong
    Shall gather at that summons strong
    Broglie Passy and he whose song
    Breathed over Syrias lioly sod
    And in the paths which Jesus trod
    And murmured midst the hills which hem
    Crownless and sad Jerusalem
    Hath echoes wheresoeer the tone
    Of Israels prophetlyre is known

    Still let them come  from Quitos walls

    And from the Orinocos tide
    From Limas Incahaunted halls
    From Santa Fe and Yucatan

    Men who by swart Guerreros side
    Proclaimed the deathless rights of man

    Broke every bond and fetter off

    And hailed in every sable serf
    A free and brother Mexican
    Chiefs who across the Andes chain

    Have followed Freedoms flowing pennon
    And seen on Junins fearful lain
    Glare oer the broken ranks of Spain

    The fireburst of Bolivars cannon



    And Hayti from her mountain land

    Shall send the sons of those who hurled
    Defiance from her blazing strand
    The wargage from her Petions hand
    Alone against a hostile world

    Nor all unmindful thou the while
    Land of the dark and mystic Nile
    Thy Moslem mercy yet may shame
    All tyrants of a Christian naine
    When in the shade of Gizehs pile
    Or where from Abyssinian hills
    El Gereks upper fountain fills
    Or where from Mountains of the Moon
    El Abiad bears his watery boon
    Whereer thy lotus blossoms swim

    Within their ancient hallowed waters
    Whereer is heard the Coptic hymn

    Or song of Nubias sable daughters
    The curse of slavery and the crime
    Thy bequest from remotest time
    At thy dark Mehemets decree
    Forevermore shall pass from thee

    And chains forsake each captives limb
    Of all those tribes whose hills around
    Have echoed back the cymbal sound

    And victor horn of Ibrahim

    And thou whose glory and whose crime
    To earths remotest bound and clime
    In mingled tones of awe and scorn
    The echoes of a world have borne
    My country  glorious at thy birth
    A daystar flashing brightly forth

    The heraldsign of Freedoms dawn
    Oh who coidd dream that saw thee then

    And watched thy rising from afar
    That vapors from oppressions fen

    Would cloud the upward tending star
    Or that earths tyrant powers which heard

    Awestruck the shout which hailed thy
    dawning
    Would rise so soon prince peer and king
    To mock thee with their welcoming
    Like Hades when her thrones were stirred

    To greet the downcast Star of Morning
    Aha  and art thou fallen thus
    Art thou become as one of us

    Land of my fathers  there will stand
    Amidst that worldassembled band
    Those owning thy maternal claim
    Unweakened by thy crime and shame
    The sad reprovers of thy wrong
    The children thou hast spurned so long

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Still with afPections fondest yearning
    To their unnatural mother turning
    No traitors they  but tried and leal
    Whose own is but thy general weal
    Still blending with the patriots zeal
    The Christians love for human kind
    To caste and climate unconfined

    A holy gathering  peaceful all
    No threat of war no savage call

    For vengeance on an erring brother
    But in their stead the godlike plan
    To teach the brotherhood of man

    To love and reverence one anotherj
    As sharers of a common blood
    The children of a common God
    Yet even at its lightest word
    Shall Slaverys darkest depths be stirred
    Spain watching from her Moros keep
    Her slaveships traversing the deep
    And Rio in her strength and pride
    Lifting along her mountain side
    Her snowj battlements and towers
    Her lemongroves and tropic bowers
    With bitter hate and sullen fear
    Its freedomgiving voice shall hear
    And where my countrys flag is flowing
    On breezes from Mount Vernon blowing

    Above the Nations council halls
    Where Freedoms praise is loud and long

    While close beneath the outward walls
    The driver plies his reeking thong

    The hammer of the manthief falls
    Oer hypocritic cheek and brow
    The crimson flush of shame shall glow
    And all who for their native land
    Are pledging life and heart and hand
    Worn watchers oer her changing weal
    Who for her tarnished honor feel
    Through cottage door and councilhall
    Shall thunder an awakening call
    The pen along its page shall burn
    With all intolerable scorn
    An eloquent rebuke shall go
    On all the winds that Southward blow
    From priestly lips now sealed and dumb
    Warning and dread appeal shall come
    Like those which Israel heard from him
    The Prophet of the Cherubim
    Or those which sad Esaias hurled
    Against a sinaccursed woild
    Its wizard leaves the Press shall fling
    Unceasing from its iron wing
    With characters inscribed thereon

    As fearful in the despots hall



    As to the pomp of Babylon

    The firesign on the palace wall

    And from her dark iniquities
    Methinks I see my country rise
    Not challenging the nations round

    To note her tardy justice done
    Her captives from their chains unbound

    Her prisons opening to the sun
    But tearfully her arms extending
    Over the poor and unoffending

    Her regal emblem now no longer
    A biid of prey with talons reeking
    Above the dying captive shrieking
    But spreading out her ample wing
    A broad impartial covering

    The weaker sheltered by the stronger
    Oh then to Faiths anointed eyes

    The promised token shall be given
    And on a nations sacrifice
    Atoning for the sin of years
    And wet with penitential tears

    The fire shall fall from Heaven



    MASSACHUSETTS TO VIRGINIA

    Written on reading an account of the pro
    ceedings of the citizens of Norfolk Va in
    reference to George Latimer the alleged fugi
    tive slave who was seized in Boston without
    warrant at the request of James B Grey of
    Norfolk claiming to he his master The case
    caused great excitement North and South and
    led to the presentation of a petition to Con
    gress signed by more than fifty thousand cit
    izens of Massachusetts calling for such laws
    and proposed amendments to the Constitution
    as should relieve the Commonwealth from all
    further participation in the crime of oppression
    George Latimer himself was finally given free
    papers for the sum of four hundred dollars

    The blast from Freedoms Northern hills

    upon its Southern way
    Bears greeting to Virginia from IMassa

    chusetts Bay
    No word of haughty challenging nor battle

    bugles peal
    Nor steady tread of marching files nor

    clang of horsemens steel

    No trains of deepmouthed camion along

    our highways go
    Around our silent arsenals untrodden lies

    the snow



    MASSACHUSETTS TO VIRGINIA



    287



    And to the landbreeze of our ports upon

    their errands far
    A thousand sails of commerce swell but

    none are spread for war

    We hear thy threats Viiginia  thy stormy

    words and high
    Swell harshly on the Southern winds which

    melt along our sky
    Yet not one brown hard hand foregoes its

    honest labor here
    No hewer of our mountain oaks suspends

    his axe in fear

    Wild are the waves which lash the reefs
    along St Georges bank

    Cold on the shores of Labrador the fog
    lies white and dank

    Through storm and wave and blinding
    mist stout are the hearts which man

    The fishingsmacks of Marblehead the sea
    boats of Cape Ann

    The cold north light and wintry sun glare

    on their icy forms
    Bent grimly oer their straining lines or

    wrestling with the storms
    Free as the winds they drive before rough

    as the waves they roam
    They laugh to scorn the slavers threat

    against their rocky home

    What means the Old Dominion Hath

    she forgot the day
    When oer her conquered valleys swept

    the Britons steel array
    How side by side with sons of hers the

    Massachusetts men
    Encountered Tarletons charge of fire and

    stout Cornwallis then

    Forgets she how the Bay State in answer

    to the call
    Of her old House of Burgesses spoke out

    from Faneuil Hall
    When echoing back her Henrys cry

    came pulsing on each breath
    Of Northern winds the thrilling sounds of

    Liberty or Death

    What asks the Old Dominion If now

    her sons have proved
    False to their fatliers memory false to the

    faith they loved



    If she can scoff at Freedom and its great

    charter spurn
    Must we of Massachusetts from truth and

    duty turn

    We hunt your bondmen flying from Sla
    verys hateful hell

    Our voices at your bidding take up the
    bloodhounds yell

    We gather at your summons above our
    fathers graves

    From Freedoms holy altarhorns to teai
    your wretched slaves f

    Thank God  not yet so vilely can Massa
    chusetts bow

    The spirit of her early time is with her even
    now

    Dream not because her Pilgrim blood moves
    slow and calm and cool

    She thus can stoop her chainless neck a sis
    ters slave and tool

    All that a sister State shoidd do all that a
    free State may

    Heart hand and purse we proffer as in our
    early day

    But that one dark loathsome burden ye must
    stagger with alone

    And reap the bitter harvest which ye your
    selves have sown

    Hold while ye may your struggling slaves

    and burden Gods free air
    With womans shriek beneath the lash and

    manhoods wild despair
    Cling closer to the  cleaving curse  that

    writes upon your plains
    The blasting of Almighty wrath against a

    land of chains

    Still shame your gallant ancestry the cava
    liers of old

    By watching round the shambles where hu
    man flesh is sold

    Gloat oer the newborn child and count
    his market value when

    The maddened mothers cry of woe shall
    pierce the slavers den I

    Lower than plummet soundeth sink the

    Plant if ye will your fathers graves with

    ANTISLxWERY POEMS



    Be if ye will the scandal of Gods fair uni
    verse

    We wash our hands forever of your sin and
    shame and curse

    A voice from lips whereon the coal from
    Freedoms shrine hath been

    Thrilled as but yesterday the hearts of
    Berkshires mountain men

    The echoes of that solenm voice are sadly
    lingering still

    In all our sunny valleys on every wind
    swept hill

    And when the prowling manthief came

    hunting for his prey
    Beneath the very shadow of Bunkers shaft

    of gray
    How through the free lips of the son the

    fathers warning spoke
    How from its bonds of trade and sect the

    Pilgrim city broke

    A hundred thousand right arms were lifted

    up on high
    A hmicbed thousand voices sent back their

    loud reply
    Through the thronged towns of Essex the

    startling summons rang
    And up from bench and loom and wheel her

    young mechanics sprang

    The voice of free broad Middlesex of thou
    sands as of one

    The shaft of Bunker calling to that of Lex
    ington

    From Norfolks ancient villages from Ply
    mouths rocky bound

    To wheie Nantucket feels the arms of ocean
    close her round

    From rich and rural Worcester where

    through the calm repose
    Of cultured vales and fringing woods the

    gentle Nashua flows
    To where Wachusets wintry blasts the

    mountain larches stir
    Swelled up to Heaven the thrilling cry of

    God save Latimer

    And sandy Barnstable rose up wet with the

    salt sea spray
    And Bristol sent her answering shout down

    Narragansett Bay



    Along the broad Connecticut old Hampden

    felt the thrill
    And the cheer of Hampshires woodmen

    swept down from Holyoke Hill

    The voice of Massachusetts  Of her free
    sons and daughters

    Deep calling unto deep aloud the sound of
    many waters

    Against the burden of that voice wliat ty
    rant power shall stand

    No fetters in the Bay State  No slave
    upon her land

    Look to it well Virginians  In calmness

    we have borne
    In answer to our faith and trust your insult

    and your scorn
    You ve spurned our kindest counsels

    you ve hunted for our lives
    And shaken round our hearths and homes

    your manacles and gyves

    We wage no war we lift no arm we fling

    no torch within
    The firedamps of the quaking mine beneath

    your soil of sin
    We leave ye with your bondmen to wrestle

    while ye can
    With the strong upward tendencies and

    godlike soul of man

    But for us and for our children the vow

    which we have given
    For freedom and humanity is registered in

    heaven
    No slaveliunt in our borders  no pirate

    on our strand
    No fetters in the Bay State  no slave

    upon our land



    THE CHRISTIAN SLAVE

    In a publication of L F Tasistro  Random
    Shots and Southern Breezes   is a description of
    a slave auction at New Orleans at which the
    auctioneer recommended the woman on the
    stand as  A good Christian   It was not
    nneommon to see advertisements of slaves for
    sale in which they were described as pious or
    as members of the church In one advertise
    ment a slave was noted as  a Baptist preacher



    THE SENTENCE OF JOHN L BROWN



    289



    A Christian  going gone
    Who bids for Gods own image  for his

    grace
    Which that poor victim of the marketplace

    Hath iu her suffering won

    My God  can such things be
    Hast Thou not said that whatsoeer is done
    Unto Thy weakest and Thy humblest one

    Is even done to Thee

    In that sad victim then
    Child of Thy pitying love I see Thee stand
    Once more the jestword of a mocking band

    Bound sold and scourged again

    A Christian up for sale
    Wet with her blood your whips oertask

    her frame
    Make her life loathsome with your wrong
    and shame
    Her patience shall not fail

    A heathen hand might deal
    Back on your heads the gathered wrong of

    years
    But her low broken prayer and nightly
    tears
    Ye neither heed nor feel

    Con well thy lesson oer
    Thou prudent teacher tell the toiling slave
    No dangerous tale of Him who came to save

    The outcast and the poor

    But wisely shut the ray
    Of Gods free Gospel from her simple heart
    And to her darkened mind alone impart

    One stern command Obey

    So shalt thou deftly raise
    The market price of human flesh  and while
    On thee their pampered guest the planters
    smile

    Thy church shall praise

    Grave reverend men shall tell
    From Northern pulpits how thy work was

    blest
    While in that vile South Sodom first and
    best
    Thy poor disciples sell

    Oh shame  the Moslem thrall
    Who with his master to the Prophet kneels



    While turning to the sacred Kebla feels
    His fetters break and fall

    Cheers for the turbaned Bey
    Of robberpeopled Tunis  he hath torn
    The dark slave  dungeons open and hath
    borne

    Their inmates into day

    But our poor slave in vain
    Turns to the Christian shrine his aching

    eyes
    Its rites will only swell his market price

    And rivet on his chain

    God of all right  how long
    Shall priestly robbers at Thine altar stand
    Lifting in prayer to Thee the bloody hand

    And haughty brow of wrong

    Oh from the fields of cane
    From the low riceswamp from the traders

    cell
    From the black slaveships foul and loath
    some hell
    And coffles weary chain

    Hoarse horrible and strong
    Rises to Heaven that agonizing cry
    Filling the arches of the hollow sky

    How long O God how long



    THE SENTENCE OF JOHN L
    BROWN

    John L Brown a young white man of South
    Carolina was in 1844 sentenced to death for
    aiding a young slave woman whom he loved
    and had married to escape from slavery In
    pronoimcing the sentence Judge ONeale ad
    dressed to the prisoner words of appalling blas
    phemy of which the following passages give
    some notion

    You are to die     Of your past life I know no
    thing except what your trial furnislied That told me
    that the crime for which you are to suffer was tlie con
    sequence of a want of attention on your part to the
    duties of life The strange woman snared you She
    flattered you with her word and you became lier vic
    tim The consequence was that led on by a desire to
    serve her you committed tlie offence of aiding a slave
    to run away and depart from her masters service  and
    nove for it you are to die

    You are young  quite too young to be where you
    are If you had remembered your Creator in your past
    days you would not now be in a felons place to re
    ceive a felons judgment Still it is not too late to
    remember your Creator He calls early and He calls

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    late He stretches out the arms of a Fathers love to
    you  to the vilest sinner  and says   Come unto me
    and be saved

    No event in the history of the antislavery
    struggle so stirred the two hemispheres as did
    this dreadful sentence A cry of horror was
    heard from Europe In the British House of
    Lords Brougham and Denman spoke of it with
    mingled pathos and indignation Thirteen
    hundred clergymen and church officers in
    Great Britain addressed a memorial to the
    churches of iSouth Carolina against the atrocity
    Indeed so strong was the pressure of the sen
    timent of abhorrence and disgust that South
    Carolina yielded to it and the sentence was
    commuted to scourging and banishment

    Ho  thou who seekest late and long

    A License from the Holy Book
    For brutal lust and fiendish wrong

    Man of the Pulpit look
    Lift up those cold and atheist eyes

    This ripe fruit of thy teaching see
    And tell us how to heaven will rise
    The incense of this sacrifice

    This blossom of the gallows tree

    Search out for slaverys hour of need

    Some fitting text of sacred writ
    Give heaven the credit of a deed

    Which shames the nether pit
    Kneel smooth blasphemer unto Him

    Whose truth is on thy lips a lie
    Ask that His bright winged cherubim
    May bend around that scaffold grim

    To guard and bless and sanctify

    O champion of the peoples cause

    Suspend thy loud and vain rebuke
    Of foreign wrong and Old Worlds laws

    Man of the Senate look
    Was this the promise of the free

    The great hope of our early time
    That slaverys poison vine should be
    Upborne by Freedoms prayernursed tree

    Oerclustered with such fruits of crime

    Send out the summons East and West

    And South and North let all be there
    Where he who pitied the oppressed

    Swings out in sun and air
    Let not a Democratic hand

    The grisly hangmans task refuse
    There let each loyal patriot stand
    Awaiting slaverys command

    To twist the rope and draw the noose



    But vain is irony  unmeet

    Its cold rebuke for deeds which start
    In fiery and indignant beat

    The pulses of the heart
    Leave studied wit and guarded phrase

    For those who think but do not feel
    Let men speak out in words which raise
    Whereer they fall an answering blaze

    Like flints which strike the fire from steel

    Still let a mousing priesthood ply

    Their garbled text and gloss of sin
    And make the lettered scroll deny

    Its living soul within
    Still let the placefed titled knave

    Plead robberys right with purchased lips
    And tell us that our fathers gave
    For Freedoms pedestal a slave

    The frieze and moulding chains and
    whips

    But ye who own that Higher Law

    Whose tablets in the heart are set
    Speak out in words of power and awe

    That God is living yet
    Breathe forth once more those tones sublime

    Whicli thrilled the burdened prophets
    lyre
    And in a dark and evil time
    Smote down on Israels fast of crime

    And gift of blood a rain of fire

    Oh not for us the graceful lay

    To whose soft measures lightly move
    The footsteps of the faun and fay

    Oerlocked by mirth and love
    But such a stern and startling strain

    As Britains hunted bards flung down
    From Snowden to the conquered plain
    Where harshly clanked the Saxon chain

    On trampled field and smoking town

    By Libertys dishonored name

    By mans lost hope and failing trust
    By words and deeds which bow with shame

    Our foreheads to the dust
    By the exulting strangers sneer

    Borne to us from the Old Worlds
    thrones
    And by their victims grief who hear
    In sunless mines and dungeons drear

    How Freedoms land her faith disowns

    In vain against the clang of swords

    The wailing pipe is blown
    Act act in Gods name while ye may

    Smite from the church her leprous limb
    Throw open to the light of day
    The bondmans cell and break away

    The chains the state has bound on him

    Ho  every true and living soul

    To Freedoms perilled altar bear
    The Freemans and the Christians whole

    Tongue pen and vote and prajer
    One last great battle for the right

    One short sharp struggle to be free
    To do is to succeed  our fight
    Is waged in Heavens approving sight

    The smile of God is Victory

    VOICE OF NEW ENGLAND

    The five poems immediately following indi
    cate the intense feeling of the friends of free
    dom in view of the annexation of Texas with
    its vast territory sufficient as was boasted for
    six new slave States The first poem seems
    to have been written at the earnest entreaty
    of Lowell who called on Whittier  to cry
    alond and spare not against the accursed Texas
    plot

    Up the hillside down the glen
    Rouse the sleeping citizen
    Summon out the might of men

    Like a Hon growling low
    Like a nightstorm rising slow
    Like the tread of unseen foe

    It is coming it is nigh

    Stand joiir homes and altars by

    On your own free thresholds die

    Clang the bells in all your spires
    On the gray hills of your sires
    Fling to heaven your signalfires

    From Wachuset lone and bleak

    Laito Berkshires tallest peak

    Let the flametongned heralds speak

    Oh for God and duty stand
    Heart to heart and hand to hand
    Round the old graves of the land



    Whoso shrinks or falters now
    Whoso to the yoke would bow
    Brand the craven on his brow

    Freedoms soil hath only place
    For a free and fearless race
    None for traitors false and base

    Perish party perish clan
    Strike together while ye can
    Like the arm of one strong man

    Like that angels voice sublime
    Heard above a Avorld of crime
    Crying of the end of time

    With one heart and with one mouth
    Let the North unto the South
    Speak the word befitting both

    What though Issachar be strong
    Ye may load his back with wrong
    Overmuch and over long

    Patience with her cup oerrun
    With her weary thread outspun
    Murmurs that her work is done

    Make our LTnionbond a chain
    Weak as tow in Freedoms strain
    Link by link shall snap in twain

    Vainly shall your sandwrought rope
    Bind the starry cluster up
    Shattered over heavens blue cope

    Give us bright though broken rays
    Rather than eternal haze
    Clouding oer the fullorbed blaze

    Take your land of sun and bloom
    Only leave to Freedom room
    For her plough and forge and loom

    Take your slaveryblackened vales
    Leave us but our own free gales
    Blowing on our thousand sails

    Boldly or with treacherous art
    Strike the bloodwrought chain apart
    Break the Unions mighty heart

    Work the ruin if ye will
    Pluck upon your heads an ill
    Which shall grow and deepen still

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    With your bondmans right arm bare
    With his heart of black despair
    Stand alone if stand ye dare

    Onward with your fell design
    Dig the gulf and draw the line
    Fire beneath your feet the mine

    Deeply when the wide abyss
    Yawns between yonr land and this
    Shall ye feel your helplessness

    By the hearth and in the bed
    Shaken by a look or tread
    Ye shall own a guilty dread

    And the curse of unpaid toil
    Downward through your generous soil
    Like a fire shall burn and spoil

    Our bleak hills shall bud and blow
    Vines our rocks shall overgrow
    Plenty in our valleys How

    And when vengeance clouds your skies
    Hither shall ye turn your eyes
    As the lost on Paradise

    We but ask our rocky strand
    Freedoms true and brother band
    Freedoms strong and honest hand

    Valleys by the slave untrod
    And the Pilgrims mountain sod
    Blessed of our fathers God



    TO FANEUIL HALL

    Written in 1844 on reading a call by  a
    Massachusetts Freeman  for a meeting in
    Faneuil Hall of the citizens of Massachusetts
    without distinction of party opposed to the an
    nexation of Texas and the aggressions of South
    Carolina and in favor of decisive action against
    slavery

    Men  if manhood still ye claim

    If the Northern pulse can thrill
    Roused by wrong or stung b shame

    Freely strongly still
    Let the sounds of trafiic die

    Shut the millgate leave the stall
    Fling the axe and hammer by

    Throns to Faneuil Hall



    Wrongs which freemen never brooked

    Dangers grim and fierce as they
    Which like couching lions looked

    On your fathers way
    These your instant zeal demand

    Shaking with their earthquakecall
    Every rood of Pilgrim land

    Ho to Faneuil Hall

    From your capes and sandy bars

    From your mountainridges cold
    Through whose pines the westering stars

    Stoop their crowns of gold
    Come and with your footsteps wake

    Echoes from that holy wall
    Once again for Freedoms sake

    Rock your fathers hall

    Up and tread beneath your feet

    Every cord by party spun
    Let your hearts together beat

    As the heart of one
    Banks and tariffs stocks and trade

    Let them rise or let them fall
    Freedom asks your common aid

    Up to Faneuil Hall

    Up and let each voice that speaks

    Ring from thence to Southern plains
    Sharply as the blow which breaks

    Prisonbolts and chains
    Speak as well becomes the free

    Dreaded more than steel or ball
    Shall your calmest utterance be

    Heard from Faneuil Hall

    Have they wronged us  Let us then

    Render back nor threats nor prayers
    Have they chained our freeborn men

    Let us unchain theirs
    Up your banner leads the van

    Blazoned  Liberty for all
    Finish what your sires began

    Up to Faneuil Hall



    TO MASSACHUSETTS

    What though around thee blazes

    No fiery rallying sign
    From all thy own high places

    Give heaven the light of thine
    What though unthrilled unmoving

    The statesman stand apart



    THE PINETREE



    293



    And comes no warm approving
    From Mammons crowded mart

    Still let the land be shaken

    By a summons of thine own
    By all save truth forsaken

    Stand fast with that alone
    Shrink not from strife unequal

    With the best is alvays hope
    And ever in the sequel

    God holds the right side up

    But when with thine uniting

    Come voices long and loud
    And faroff hills are writing

    Thy firewords on the cloud
    When from Penobscots fountains

    A deep response is heard
    And across the Western moimtains

    Rolls back thy rallying word

    Shall thy line of battle falter

    With its allies just in view
    Oh by hearth and holy altar

    My fatherland be true
    Fling abroad thy scrolls of Freedom

    Speed them onward far and fast
    Over hill and valley speed them

    Like the sibyls on the blast

    Lo  the Empire State is shaking

    The shackles from her hand
    With the rugged North is waking

    The level sunset land
    On they come the free battalions

    East and West and North they come
    And the heartbeat of the millions

    Is the beat of Freedoms drum

    To the tyrants plot no favor

    No heed to placefed knaves
    Bar and bolt the door forever

    Against the land of slaves
    Hear it mother Earth and hear it

    The heavens above us spread
    The laud is roused  its spirit

    Was sleeping but not dead



    NEW HAMPSHIRE

    God bless New Hampshire  from her

    granite peaks
    Once more the voice of Stark and Langdon

    speaks



    The longbound vassal of the exulting
    South
    For very shame her selfforged chain
    has broken
    Torn the black seal of slavery from her
    mouth
    And in the clear tones of her old time
    spoken
    Oh all undreamed  of all unhoped  for
    changes
    The tyrants ally proves his sternest foe
    To all his biddings from her mountain
    ranges
    New Hampshire thunders an indignant
    No
    Who is it now despairs  Oh faint of
    heart
    Look upward to those Northern moun
    tains cold
    Flouted by Freedoms victor flag un
    rolled
    And gather strength to bear a manlier

    part
    All is not lost The angel of Gods bless
    ing
    Encamps with Freedom on the field of
    fight
    Still to her banner day by day are press

    Unlooked  for allies striking for the

    right
    Courage then Northern hearts  Be firm

    be true
    What one brave State hath done can ye not

    also do



    THE PINETREE

    Written on hearing that the AntiSlavery Re
    solves of Stephen C Phillips had been rejected
    by the Whig Convention in Faneuil Hall in
    1846

    Lift again the stately emblem on the Bay

    States rusted shield
    Give to Northern winds the PineTree on

    our banners tattered field
    Sons of men who sat in council with their

    Bibles round the board
    Answering Englands royal missive with a

    firm  Thus saith the Lord
    Rise again for home and freedom  set the

    battle in array

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Tell us not of banks and tariffs cease your

    paltry pedler cries
    Shall the good State sink her honor that

    your gambling stocks may rise
    Would ye barter man for cotton  That

    your gains may sum up higher
    Must we kiss the feet of Moloch pass our

    children through the fire
    Is the dollar only real  God and truth

    and right a dream
    Weighed against your lying ledgers must

    our manhood kick the beam

    O my God  for that free spirit which of

    old in Boston town
    Smote the Province House with terror

    struck the crest of Audros down
    For another strongvoiced Adams in the

    citys streets to cry
    Up for God and Massachusetts  Set

    your feet on Mammons lie
    Perish banks and perish traffic spin your

    cottons latest pound
    But in Heavens name keep your honor

    keep the heart o the Bay State

    sound

    Where s the man for Massachusetts

    Where s the voice to speak her free
    Where s the hand to light up bonfires from

    her mountains to the sea
    Beats her Pilgrim pulse no longer  Sits

    she dumb in her despair
    Has she none to break the silence  Has

    slie none to do and dare
    O my God  for one right worthy to lift up

    her rusted shield
    And to plant again the PineTree in her

    banners tattered field



    TO A SOUTHERN STATESMAN

    John C Calhoun who had strongly urged
    the extension of slave territory by the annexa
    tion of Texas even if it shoidd involve a war
    with England was unwilling to promote the
    acquisition of Oregon which would enlarge
    the Northern domain of freedom and pleaded
    as an excuse tlie peril of foreign complications
    which he had defied when the interests of sla
    very were involved

    Is this thy voice whose treble notes of fear
    Wail in the wind  And dost thou shake
    to hear



    Actaeonlike the bay of thine own hounds
    Spurning the leasb and leaping oer their

    bounds
    Sore  baffled statesman  when thy eager

    hand
    With game afoot unslipped the hungry

    pack
    To hunt down Freedom iu her chosen land
    Hadst thou no fear that erelong doubling

    back
    These dogs of thine might snuff on Sla
    verys track
    Where s now the boast which even thy

    guarded tongue
    Cold calm and proud in the teeth o the

    Senate flung
    Oer the fulfilment of thy baleful plan
    Like Satans triumjjh at the fall of man
    How stoodst tliou then thy feet on Free
    dom planting
    And pointing to the lurid heaven afar
    Whence all could see through the south

    windows slanting
    Crimson as blood the beams of that Lone

    Star
    The Fates are just  they give us but our

    own
    Nemesis ripens what our hands have sown
    There is an Eastern storj not unknown
    Doubtless to thee of one wliose magic

    skill
    Called demons up his waterjars to fill
    Deftly and silently they did his will
    But when the task was done kept pouiiug

    still
    In vain with S2ell and charm the wizard

    wrought
    Faster and faster were the buckets brought
    Higher and higher rose the flood around
    Till the fiends clapped their hands above

    their master drowned
    So Carolinian it may prove witli thee
    For God still overrules mans schemes and

    takes
    Craftiness in its selfset snare and makes
    The wrath of man to praise Him It may

    be
    That the roused spirits of Democracy
    May leave to freer States the same wide

    door
    Through which thy slavecursed Texas en
    tered in
    From out the blood and fire the wrong and

    sin
    Of the stormed city and the ghastly plain



    AT WASHINGTON



    295



    Beat by hot hail and wet with bloody rain
    The myriadhanded pioneer may ponr
    And the wild West with the roused North

    combine
    And heave the engineer of evil with his



    AT WASHINGTON

    yuggested by a visit to the city of Washing
    ton in the 12th month of 1845 Originally en
    titled Lines

    With a cold and wintry noonlight

    On its roofs and steeples shed
    Shadows weaving with the sunlight
    From the gray sky overhead
    Broadly vaguely all around me lies the
    halfbuilt town outspread

    Through this broad street restless ever

    Ebbs and flows a human tide
    Wave on wave a living river

    Wealth and fashion side by side
    Toiler idler slave and master in the same
    quick current glide

    Underneath yon dome whose coping
    Springs above them vast and tall
    Grave men in the dust are groping
    For the largess base and small
    Which the hand of Power is scattering
    crumbs which from its table fall

    Base of heart  They vilely barter
    Honors wealth for partys place
    Step by step on Freedons cliarter
    Leaving footprints of disgrace
    For todays poor pittance turning from the
    great hope of their race

    Yet where festal lamps are throwing

    Glory round the dancers hair
    Goldtressed like an angels flowing
    Backward on the sunset air
    And the low quick pulse of music beats its
    measure sweet and rare

    There tonight shall womans glances

    Starlike welcome give to them
    Fawning fools with shy advances
    Seek to touch their garments hem
    With the tongue of flattery glozing deeds
    which God and Truth coudenm



    From this glittering lie my vision
    Takes a broader sadder range
    Full before me have arisen

    Other pictures dark and strange
    From the parlor to the prison miist the
    scene and witness change

    Hark  the heavy gate is swinging

    On its hinges harsh and slow
    One pale prison lamp is flinging
    On a fearful group below
    Such a light as leaves to terror whatsoeer
    it does not show

    Pitying God  Is that a woman

    On whose wrist the shackles clash
    Is that shriek she utters human
    Underneath the stinging lash
    Are they men whose eyes of madness from
    that sad procession flash

    Still the dance goes gayly onward
    What is it to Wealth and Pride
    That without the stars are looking
    On a scene which earth should hide
    That the slaveship lies in waiting rocking
    on Potomacs tide

    Vainly to that mean Ambition

    Which upon a rivals fall
    Winds above its old condition
    With a reptiles slimy crawl
    Shall the pleading voice of sorrow shall the
    slave in anguish call

    Vainly to the child of Fashion

    Giving to ideal woe
    Graceful luxury of compassion
    Shall the stricken mourner go
    Hateful seems the earnest sorrow beautiful
    the hollow show

    Nay my words are all too sweeping

    In this crowded human mart
    Feeling is not dead but sleeping
    Mans strong will and womans heart
    In the coming strife for Freedom yet shall
    bear their generous part

    And from yonder sunny valleys
    Southward in the distance lost
    Freedom yet shall summon allies
    Worthier than the North can boast
    With the Evil by their hearthstones grap
    pling at severer cost

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Now the soul alone is willing

    Faint the heart and weak the knee
    And as yet no lip is thrilling

    With the mighty words  Be Free
    Tarrieth long the lands Good Angel but
    his advent is to be

    Meanwhile turning from the revel

    To the prisoncell my sight
    For intenser hate of evil
    For a keener sense of right
    Shaking off thy dust I thank thee City of
    the Slaves tonight

    To thy duty now and ever

    Dreain no more of rest or stay
    Give to Freedoms great endeavor
    All thou art and hast today
    Thus above the citys murmur saith a
    Voice or seems to say

    Ye with heart and vision gifted
    To discern and love the right
    Whose worn faces have been lifted
    To the slowlygrowing light
    Where from Freedoms sunrise drifted
    slowly back the murk of night

    Ye who through long years of trial
    Still have held your purpose fast
    While a lengthening shade the dial
    From tke westering sunshine cast
    And of hope each hours denial seemed an
    echo of the last

    O my brothers  O my sisters

    Would to God that ye were near
    Gazing with me down the vistas
    Of a sorrow strange and drear
    Would to God that ye were listeners to the
    Voice I seem to hear

    Witli the storm above us driving

    With the false earth mined below
    Who shall marvel if thus striving
    We have counted friend as foe
    Unto one another giving in the darkness
    blow for blow

    Well it may be that our natures

    Have grown sterner and more hard
    And the freshness of their features
    Somewhat harsh and battlescarred
    And their harmonies of feeling overtasked
    and rudely jarred



    Be it so It should not swerve us

    From a purpose true and brave
    Dearer Freedoms rugged service
    Than the pastime of the slave
    Better is the storm above it than the quiet
    of the grave

    Let us then uniting bury

    All oiir idle feuds in dust
    And to future conflicts carry

    Mutual faith and common trust
    Always he who most forgiveth in his brother
    is most just

    From the eternal shadow rounding

    All our sun and starlight here
    Voices of our lost ones sounding
    Bid us be of heart and cheer
    Through the silence down the spaces fall
    ing on the inward ear

    Know we not our dead are looking

    Downward with a sad surprise
    AH om strife of words rebuking
    With their mild and loving eyes
    Shall we grieve the holy angels  Shall we
    cloud their blessed skies

    Let us draw their mantles oer us
    Which have fallen in our way
    Let us do the work before us
    Cheerly bravely while we may
    Ere the long nightsilence cometli and
    with us it is not day



    THE BRANDED HAND

    Captain Jonathan Walker of Harwich
    Mass was solicited by several fugitive slaves
    at Pensacola Florida to carry them iu his
    vessel to the British West Indies Although
    well aware of the great hazard of the enter
    prise he attempted to comply with the request
    but was seized at sea by an American vessel
    consigned to the authorities at Kej AVest and
    thence sent back to Pensacola where after
    a long and rigorous confinement in prison he
    was tried and sentenced to be branded on his
    right hand with the letters  S S slave
    stealer and amerced in a heavy fine

    Welcome home again brave seaman

    with thy thoughtful brow and gray
    And the old heroic spirit of our earlier

    better day



    THE BRANDED HAND



    297



    With that front of calm endurance on
    whose steady nerve in vain

    Pressed the iron of the prison smote the
    fiery shafts of pain

    Is the tyrants hrand upon thee  Did the
    brutal cravens aim

    To make Gods truth thy falsehood His
    holiest work thy shame

    When all bloodquenched from the tor
    ture the iron was withdrawn

    How laughed their evil angel the baffled
    fools to scorn

    They change to wrong the duty which God

    hath written out
    On the great heart of humanity too legible

    for doubt
    They the loathsome moral lepers blotched

    from footsole up to crown
    Give to shame what God hath given unto

    honor and renown

    Why that brand is highest honor  than

    its traces never yet
    Upon old armorial hatchments was a

    prouder blazon set
    And thy unborn generations as they tread

    our rocky strand
    Shall tell with pride the story of their

    fathers branded hand

    As the Templar home was welcome bear
    ing back from Syrian wars

    The scars of Arab lances and of Paynim

    friend of God and man

    He suffered for the ransom of the dear
    Redeemers grave

    Thoa for His living presence in the bound
    and bleeding slave

    He for a soil no longer by the feet of an
    gels trod

    Thou for the true Shechinah the present
    home of God

    For while the jurist sitting with the
    slave whip oer liim swunj

    From the tortured truths of freedom the
    lie of slavery wrung



    And the solemn priest to Moloch on each

    the bondman

    While the multitude in blindness to a far

    And spurned the while the temple where
    a present Saviour dwelt

    Thou beheldst Him in the taskfield in the
    prison shadows dim

    And thy mercy to the bondman it was
    mercy unto Him

    In thy lone and long nightwatches sky

    above and wave below
    Thou didst learn a higher wisdom than the

    babbling schoohnen know

    angels only can
    That the one sole sacred thing beneath the

    Tlia he who treads profanely on the scrolls

    of law and cieed
    In the depth of Gods great goodness may

    find mercy in liis need
    But woe to him who crushes the soul with

    chain and rod
    And herds with lower natures the awful

    form of God

    Then lift that manly righthand bold

    ploughman of tlie wave

    His heart swell strong within him his

    Hold it up before our sunshine up against

    Ho  men of Massachusetts for the love of

    God look there
    Take it henceforth for your standard like

    the Bruce
    In the dark strife closing round ye let that

    hand be seen before

    And the masters of the slaveland shall

    tremble at that sign
    When it points its finger Southward along

    THE FREED ISLANDS

    Written for the anniversary celebration of
    the fiist of August at Milton 1843 Origi
    nally entitled Lines

    A FEW brief years have passed away

    Since Britain drove her million slaves
    Beneath the tropic
    God willed their freedom  and today
    Life blooms above those island graves

    He spoke  across the Carib Sea

    We heard the clash of breaking chains

    And felt the heartthrob of the free

    The first strong pulse of liberty

    s veins

    Though long delayed and far and slow

    The Briton
    Wears slavery here a prouder brow
    Than that which twelve short years ago
    Scowled darkly from her island bow



    Mighty alike for good or ill

    With Motherland we fully share

    The Saxon strength tlu nerve of steel

    The tireless energy of will

    The power to do the pride to dare

    What she has done can we not do

    Our hour and men are both at hand
    s angel blew
    O

    Each valley of our forest land

    Hear it old Europe  we have sworn

    The death of slavery When it falls
    Look to your vassals in their turn
    Your poor dumb millions crushed and worn
    Your prisons and your palace walls

    O kingly mockers  scoffing show

    What deeds in Freedoms name we do
    Yet know that every taunt ye throw
    Across the waters goads our slow

    Progression towards the right and true



    Not always shall your outraged poor
    Appalled by democratic crime

    Grind as their fathers ground before

    The hour which sees our prison door
    Swing wide shall be their trium2h time

    On then my brothers  every blow

    Ye deal is felt the wide earth through
    Whatever here uplifts the low
    Or humbles Freedom

    Blesses the Old World through the New

    Take heart  The promised hour draws
    near

    I hear the downward beat of wings
    And Freedoms trumpet sounding clear
    Joy to the jjeople  woe and fear

    To newworld tyrants oldworld kings



    A LETTER

    Supposed to be wiitten by the chairman of
    the
    the Hon M N Jr at Washington giving the
    result of the election

    The following verses were published in the
    Boston Chronotype in 1846 They refer to the
    contest in New Hampshire which resulted in
    the defeat of the proslavery Democracy and
    in the election of John P Hde to the United
    States Senate Although their authorship was
    not acknowledged it was strongly suspected
    They furnish a specimen of the way on the
    whole rather goodnatured in which the lib
    ertylovers of half a century ago answered the
    social and political outlawry and mob violence
    to which they were subjected

    T IS over Moses  All is lost

    I hear the bells aringing
    Of Pharaoh and his Red Sea host

    I hear the FreeWills singing
    We re routed Moses liorse and foot

    If there be truth in figures
    With Federal Whigs in hot pursuit

    And Hale and all the

    Alack  alas  this month or more

    We
    Our very dreams the burden bore

    Of central cliques exploding
    Before our eyes a furnace shone

    Where heads of dough were roasting
    And one we took to be your own

    The traitor Hale was toasting



    A LETTER



    299



    Our Belkuap brother heard with awe

    The Congo minstrels playing
    At Pittsfield Reuben Leavitt saw

    The ghost of Storrs apraying
    And Carrolls woods were sad to see

    With blackwinged crows adartiug
    And Black Snout looked on Ossipee

    Newglossed with Day and Martin

    We thought the
    Ills face seemed changing wholly

    His lips seemed thick  his nose seemed flat
    Ilis misty hair looked woolly

    And Coiis teamsters shrieking fled
    From the metamorphosed figure

    Look there   they said
    Head



    The schoolhouse out of Canaan hauled

    Seemed turning on its tiack again
    Aid like a great swampturtle crawled

    To Canaan village back again
    Shook ofl the mud and settled flat

    Upon its underpinning
    A nigger on its ridgepole sat

    From ear to ear agriuning

    Gray H d heard o nights the sound

    Of railcars onward faring
    Right over Democratic ground

    The iron horse came tearing
    A flag waved oer that spectral train

    xVs high as Pittsfield steeple
    Its emblem was a broken chain

    Its motto   To the people

    I dreamed that Charley took his bed

    With Hale for his physician
    unread

    And unreferred
    There Hayes and Tuck as nurses sat

    As near as near could be man
    Democrat

    Freeman

    Ah  grisly portents  What avail

    Your terrors of forewarning
    We wake to find the nightmare Hale

    Astride our breasts at morning
    From Portsmouth lights to Indian stream

    Our foes their throats are trying
    The very factoryspindles seem

    To mock us while they re flying



    The hills have bonfires  in our streets

    Flags flout us in our faces
    The newsboys peddling off their sheets

    Are hoarse with our disgraces
    In vain we turn for gibing wit

    And shoutings follow after
    As if old Kearsarge had split

    His granite sides with laughter

    What boots it that we pelted out

    The antislavery women
    And bravely strewed their hall about

    With tattered lace and trimming
    Was it for such a sad reverse

    Oiu mobs became peacemakers
    And kept their tar and wooden horse

    For Englishmen and Quakers

    For this did shifty Atherton

    Make gag rules for the Great House
    Wiped we for this our feet upon

    Petitions in our State House
    Plied we for this our axe of doom

    No stubborn traitor sparing
    Who scotted at our opinion loom

    And took to homespun wearing

    Ah Moses  hard it is to scan

    These crooked providences
    Deducing from the wisest plan

    The saddest consequences
    Strange that in trampling as was meet

    The niggermens petition
    We sprung a mine beneath our feet

    Which opened up perdition

    How goodly Moses was the game

    In which we ve long been actors
    Supplying freedom with the name

    And slavery vith the practice
    Our smooth words fed the peoples
    mouth

    Their ears our party rattle
    We kept them headed to the South

    As drovers do their cattle

    But now our game of politics

    The world at large is learning
    And men grown gray in all our tricks

    States evidence are turning
    Votes and preambles subtly spun

    Tliey cram with meanings louder
    And load the Democratic gun

    With abolition powder

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    The ides of June  Woe wortli the clay

    When turning all things over
    The traitor Hale shall make his hay

    From Democratic clover
    Who then shall take him in the law

    Who punish crime so flagrant
    Whose hand shall serve whose pen shall
    draw

    A writ against that  vagrant

    Alas  no hope is left us here

    And one can only pine for
    The envied place of overseer

    Of slaves in Carolina
    Pray Moses give Calhoim the wink

    And see what pay he s giving
    We ve practised long enough we think

    To know the art of driving

    And for the faithful rank and file

    Wlio know their proper stations
    Perhaps it may be worth their while

    To try the rice plantations
    Let Hale exult let Wilson scoff

    To see us soutliward scamper
    better off

    FROM A LETTER TO A YOUNG CLERICAL
    FRIEND

    A STRENGxn Thy service cannot tire
    A faith which doubt can never dim

    A heart of love a lip of fire

    O Freedoms God  be Thou to him

    Speak through him words of power and
    fear

    As through Thy prophet bards of old
    And let a scornful people hear

    Once more Thy Sinaithunders rolled

    For lying lips Thy blessing seek

    And hands of blood are raised to Thee

    And on Thy children crushed and weak
    The oppressor plants his kneeling knee

    Let then O God  Thy servant dare
    Thy truth in all its power to tell

    Unmask the priestly thieves and tear
    The Bible from the grasp of hell



    From hollow rite and narrow span
    Of law and sect by Tiiee released

    Oh teach him that the Cluistian man
    Is holier than the Jewish priest

    Chase back the shadows gray and old
    Of the dead ages from his way

    And let his hopeful eyes behold
    The dawn of Thy millennial day

    That day when fettered limb and mind
    Shall know the truth which maketh free

    And he alone who loves his kind

    Shall childlike claim the love of Thee

    He blew no trumpet in the marketplace
    Nor iu the church with hypocritic face
    Supplied with cant the lack of Christian

    grace
    Loathing pretence he did with cheerful

    will
    What others talked of while their hands

    were still
    And while  Lord Lord   the pious tyrants

    cried
    Who in the poor their Master crucified
    His daily prayer far better understood
    In acts than words was simply doing

    good
    So calm so constant was his rectitude
    That by his loss alone we know its worth
    And feel how true a man has walked with

    us on earth



    SONG OF SLAVES IN THE
    DESERT

    Suggested by a passage in Richardson
    Journal in Africa

    Where are we going  where are we going

    Where are we going Rubee
    Lord of peoples lord of lands
    Look across these shining sands
    Through the furnace of the noon
    Through the white light of the moon
    Strong the Ghiblee wind is blowiug
    Strange and large the world is growing
    Speak and tell us where we are going

    Where are we going Rubee

    Bornou land was rich and good
    Wells of water fields of food
    Dourra fields and bloom of bean
    And the palmtree cool and green
    Bornou laud we see no longer
    Here we thirst and here we hunger
    Here the Moorman smites in anger
    Where are we going Rubee

    When we went from Bornou land
    We were like the leaves and sand
    We were many we are few
    Life has one and death has two
    Whitened bones our path are showing
    Thou Allsoeing thou Allknowing
    Hear us tell us where are we going
    Where are we going Rubee



    Moons of marches from our eyes
    Bornou land behind us lies
    Stranger round us day by day
    Bends the desert circle gray
    Wild the waves of sand are flowing
    Hot the winds above them blowing
    Lord of all things  where are we going
    Where are we going Rubee

    We are weak but Thou art strong
    Short our lives but Thine is long
    We are blind but Thou hast eyes
    We are fools but Thou art wise
    Thou our morrows pathway knowing
    Through the strange world round us grow
    ing
    Hear us tell us where are we going
    Where are we going Rubee

    YORKTOWN

    Dr Thaclier surgeon in Scammers regi
    ment in Ids description of the siege of York
    town says   The labor on the Virginia plan
    tations is performed altogether by a species
    of the human race cruelly wrested from their
    native country and doomed to perpetual bond
    age while their masters are manfully contend
    ing for freedom and the natural rights of man
    uch is the inconsistency of human nature
    Eighteen hundred slaves were found at York
    town after its siirrender and restored to their
    masters Well was it said by Dr Barnes in
    his late work on Slavery   No slave Avas any
    nearer his freedom after the surrender of York
    town than when Patrick Henry first taught the
    notes of liberty to echo among the hills and
    vales of Virginia

    From Yorktowns ruins ranked and still
    Two lines stretch far o
    Who curbs his steed at head of one
    Hark  the low murmur  Washington
    Who bends his keen approving glance
    Where dovni the gorgeous line of France
    Shine knightly star and plume of snow
    Thou too art victor Rochambeau

    The earth which bears this calm array
    Shook witli the warcharge yesterday
    Ploughed deep with hurrying hoof and

    wheel
    Shotsown and bladed thick with steel
    Octobers clear and noonday sun
    Paled in the breathsmoke of the gun
    And down night
    Like a dropped star the blazing shell

    Now all is hushed  the gleaming lines
    Stand moveless as the neighboring pines



    While through them sullen grim and

    slow
    The conquered hosts of England go
    OHara
    Gay Tarletons troop rides bannerless
    Shout from thy fired and wasted liomes
    Thy scourge Yirginia captive comes

    Nor thou alone  with one glad voice

    Let all thy sister States rejoice

    Let Freedom in whatever clime

    Slie waits with sleepless eye her time

    Shouting from cave and mountain wood

    Make glad her desert solitude

    While they who hunt her quail with fear

    The New World

    But who are they who cowering wait
    Within the shattered fortress gate
    s soil
    Classed with the battle
    With household stuffs and fowl and swine
    wine
    With stolen beeves and foraged corn
    Are they not men Virginian born

    Oh veil your faces young and brave
    Sleep Scammel in thy soldier grave
    Sous of the Northland ye who set
    Stout hearts against the bayonet
    And pressed with steady footfall near
    The moated battery
    Turn your scarred faces from the sight
    Let shame do homage to the right

    Lo  fourscore years have passed  and

    where
    The Gallic bugles stirred the air
    And through breached batteries side by

    side
    To victory stormed the hosts allied
    And brave foes grounded pale with pain
    The arms thcj might not lift again
    As abject as in that old day
    The slave still toils his life away

    Oh fields still green and fresh in story
    Old days of pride old names of glory
    Old marvels of the tongue and pen
    Old thoughts which stirred the hearts of

    men
    Ye spared the wrong  and over all
    Behold the avenging shadow fall



    RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE



    Your worldwide honor stained with

    shame
    Your freedom

    Where s now the flag of that old war
    Where flows its stripe  Where burns its

    star
    Bear witness Palo Alto
    Dark Vale of Palms red Monterey
    Where Mexic Freedom young and weak
    s beak
    Symbol of terror and despair
    Of chains and slaves go seek it there

    Laugh Prussia midst thy iron ranks
    Laugh Russia from thy Neva
    Brave sport to see the fledgling born
    Of Freedom by its parent torn
    Safe now is Speilbergs dungeon cell
    Safe drear Siberia
    With Slaverys flag o
    What of the New World fears the Old



    RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE

    Though not published until 1847 several
    lines indicate that the poem was written not
    long after Randolphs death in IHoo In a letter
    published in July 1S83 Whittier says   In the
    last hoiir of his Randolph
    his soul was struggling from its broken tene
    ment his latest effort was the confirmation of
    this generous act of a former period the manu
    mission of his slaves Light rest the turf upon
    him beneath his patrimonial oaks  The prayers
    of many hearts made happy by his benevolence
    shall linger over his grave and bless it

    O Mother Iarth  upon thy lap

    Thy weary ones receiving
    And oer them silent as a dream

    Thy grassy mantle weaving
    Fold softly in thy long embrace

    That heart so worn and broken
    And cool its pidse of fire beneath

    Thy shadows old and oaken

    Shut out from him the bitter word

    And serpent hiss of scorning
    Nor let the storms of yesterday

    Disturb his quiet morning
    Breathe over him forgetfulness

    Of all save deeds of kindness
    And save to smiles of grateful eyes

    Press down his lids in blindness



    There where with living ear and eye

    He heard Potomac
    And through his tall ancestral trees

    Saw autumns sunset glowing
    He sleeps still looking to the west

    Beneath the dark wood shadow
    As if he still would see the sun

    Sink down on wave and meadow

    Bard Sage and Tribune  in himself

    All moods of mind contrasting
    The tenderest wail of human woe

    The scorn like lightning blasting
    The pathos which from rival eyes

    Unwilling tears could summon
    The stinging taunt the fiery burst

    Of hatred scarcely human

    Mirth sparkling like a diamond shower

    From lips of lifelong sadness
    Clear picturings of majestic thought

    Upon a ground of madness
    And over all Romance and Song

    A classic beauty throwing
    And laurelled Clio at his side

    Her storied pages showing

    All parties feared him  each in turn

    Beheld its schemes disjointed
    As right or left his fatal glance

    And spectral finger pointed
    Sworn foe of Cant he smote it down

    With trenchant wit unsparing
    And mocking rent with ruthless hand

    The robe Pretence was wearing

    Too honest or too proud to feign

    A love he never cherished
    Beyond Virginia

    His patriotism perished
    While others hailed in distant skies

    Our eagles dusky pinion
    He only saw the mountain bird

    Stoop o

    Still through each change of fortune
    strange

    Racked neiwe and brain all burning
    His loving faith in Motherland

    Knew never shade of turning
    By Britains lakes by Neva

    Whatever sky was oer him
    He heard her rivers

    Her blue peaks rose before him

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    He held his slaves yet made withal

    No false and vain pretences
    Nor jjaid a lying priest to seek

    For Scriptiual defences
    His harshest words of proud rebuke

    His bitterest taunt and scorning
    Fell firelike on the Northern brow

    That bent to him in fawning

    He held his slaves  yet kept the while

    His reverence for the Human
    In the dark vassals of his will

    He saw but Man and Woman
    No hunter of Gods outraged poor

    His Roanoke valley entered
    No trader in tbe souls of men

    Across his threshold ventured

    And when the old and wearied man

    Lay down for his last sleeping
    And at his side a slave no more

    His brotherman stood weeping
    His latest thought his latest breath

    To Freedom
    With failing tongue and trembling hand

    The dying blest the living

    Oh never bore his ancient State

    A truer son or braver
    None trampling with a calmer scorn

    On foreign hate or favor
    He knew her faults yet never stooped

    His proud and manly feeling
    To poor excuses of the wrong

    Or meanness of concealing

    But none beheld with clearer eye

    The plaguespot oer her spreading
    None heard more sure the steps of Doom

    Along her futiire treading
    For her as for himself he spake

    When his gaunt frame upbracing
    He traced with dying hand

    And perished in the tracing

    As from tlie grave where Henry sleeps

    From Vernon
    And from the grassy pall which hides

    The Sage of Monticello
    So from tlie leafstrewn burialstone

    Of Randolphs lowly dwelling
    Virginia  o

    A warnintr voice is swelling



    And hark  from thy deserted fields

    Are sadder warnings spoken
    From quenched hearths where thy exiled
    sons

    Their household gods have broken
    The curse is on thee  wolves for men

    And briers for cornsheaves giving
    Oh more than all thy dead renown

    Were now one hero living

    THE SLAVES OF MARTINIQUE



    305



    Hath called thee from thy taskfield

    shall not lack
    Yet bolder champions to beat bravely
    back
    The wrong which through his poor ones

    reaches Him
    Yet firmer hands shall Freedom
    lights trim
    And wave them high across the abysmal
    black
    Till bound dumb millions there shall see
    them and rejoice



    THE SLAVES OF MARTINIQUE

    Suggested by a daguerreotype taken from
    a small French engraving of two negro figures
    sent to the writer by Oliver Johnson

    Beams of noon like burning lances through
    the treetops flash and glisten

    As she stands before her lover with raised
    face to look and listen

    Dark but comely like the maiden in the

    ancient Jewish song
    Scarcely has the toil of taskfields done her

    graceful beauty wrong

    He the strong one and the manly with the

    vassals garb and hue
    Holding still his spirit

    higher nature true

    Hiding deep the strengthening purpose of

    a freeman in his heart
    As the gregree holds his Fetich from the

    white mans gaze apart

    Ever foremost of his comrades when the

    driver
    Calls away to stifling millhouse to the

    fields of cane and corn

    Fall the keen and burning lashes never on

    his back or limb
    Scarce with look or word of censure turns

    the driver unto him

    Yet his brow is always thoughtful and his

    eye is hard and stern
    Slaverys last and liumblest lesson he has

    never deigned to learn



    And at evening when his comrades dance
    before their master

    Folding arms and knitting forehead stands
    he silent evermore

    God be praised for every instinct which

    rebels against a lot
    Where the brute survives the human and

    mans upright form is not

    As the serpentlike bejuco winds his spiral

    fold on fold
    Round the tall and stately ceiba till it

    withers in his hold

    Slow decays the forest mouarch closer

    girds the fell embrace
    Till the tree is seen no longer and the vine

    is in its place

    So a base and bestial nature round the vas
    sal

    And the spirit wastes beneath it like the
    ceiba choked with vines

    God is Love saith the Evangel  and our

    world of woe and sin
    Is made light and happy only when a Love

    is shining in

    Ye whose lives are free as sunshine finding
    wheresoeer ye roam

    Smiles of welcome looks of kindness mak
    ing all the world like home

    In the veins of whose affections kindred

    blood is but a part
    Of one kindly current throbbing from the

    universal heart

    Can ye know the deeper meaning of a love

    in Slavery nursed
    Last flower of a lost Eden blooming in that

    Soil accursed

    Love of Home and Love of Woman
    dear to all but doubly dear

    To the heart whose pulses elsewhere meas
    ure only hate and fear

    All around the desert circles underneath a

    brazen sky
    Only one green spot remaining where the

    dew is never diy

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    From the horror of that desert from its

    atmosphere of hell
    Turns the fainting spirit thither as the

    diver seeks his bell

    T is the fervid tropic noontime  faint and

    low the seawaves beat
    Hazy rise the inland mountains through the

    glimmer of the heat

    Where through mingled leaves and blos
    soms arrowy sunbeams flash and
    glisten

    Speaks her lover to the slavegirl and she
    lifts her head to listen

    We shall live as slaves no longer  Free
    doms hour is close at hand

    Rocks her bark upon the waters rests the
    boat upon the strand

    I have seen the Haytien Captain  I have

    seen his swarthy crew
    Haters of the pallid faces to their race and

    color true

    They have sworn to wait our coming till
    the night has passed its noon

    And the gray and darkening waters roll
    above the sunken moon

    Oh the blessed hope of freedom  how with
    joy and glad surprise

    For an instant throbs her bosom for an in
    stant beam her eyes

    But she looks across the valley where her

    mothers hut is seen
    Through the snowy bloom of coffee and

    the lemonleaves so green

    It
    were wrong for thee to stay

    God hath heard thy prayer for freedom
    and His finger points the way

    Well I know with what endurance for the

    sake of me and mine
    Thou hast borne too long a burden never

    meant for souls like thine

    Go  and at the hour of midnight when

    our last farewell is o
    Kneeling on our place of parting I will

    bless thee from the shore



    But for me my mother lying on her sick
    bed all the day

    Lifts her weary head to watch me coming
    through the twilight gray

    Should I leave her sick and helpless even
    freedom shared with thee

    Woidd be sadder far than bondage lonely
    toil and stripes to me

    For my heart would die within me and
    my brain would soon be wild

    I should hear my mother calling through
    the twilight for her child i

    Blazing upward from the ocean shines the

    sun of morningtime
    Through the coffeetrees in blossom and
    green hedges of the lime

    Side by side amidst the slavegang toil the

    lover and the maid
    Wherefore looks he oer the waters leaning

    forward on his spade

    Sadly looks he deeply sighs he

    Haytiens sail he sees
    Like a white cloud of the mountains driven

    seaward by the breeze

    But his arm a light hand presses and lie

    hears a low voice call
    Hate of Slavery hope of Freedom Love is

    mightier than all



    THE CURSE OF THE CHARTER
    BREAKERS

    The rights and liberties affirmed by Magna
    Charta were deemed of such importance in the
    thirteenth century that the Bishops twice a
    year with tapers burning and in their pontifi
    cal robes pronounced in the presence of the
    king and the representatives of the estates of
    England the greater excommunication against
    the infringer of that instrument The impos
    ing ceremony took place in the great Hall of
    Westminster

    In Westminster
    Robed in their pontificals
    Englands ancient prelates stood
    For the people

    Closed around the waiting crowd
    s cloud



    THE CURSE OF THE CHARTERBREAKERS



    307



    King and council lord and knight
    Squire and yeoman stood in sight

    Stood to hear the priest rehearse
    In Gods name the Churchs curse
    By the tapers round them lit
    Slowly sternly uttering it

    Right of voice in framing laws
    Right of peers to try each cause
    Peasant homestead mean and small
    Sacred as the monarchs hall

    Whoso lays his hand on these
    Englands ancient liberties
    Whoso breaks by word or deed
    England

    Be he Prince or belted knight
    Whatsoe
    If the highest then the worst
    Let him live and die accursed

    Thou wlio to Thy Church hast given
    Keys alike of hell and heaven
    Make our word and witness sure
    Let the curse we speak endure

    Silent while that curse was said
    Every bare and listening head
    Bowed in reverent awe and then
    All the people said Amen

    Seven times the bells have tolled
    For the centuries gray and old
    Since that stoled and mitred band
    Cursed the tyrants of their land

    Since the priesthood like a tower
    Stood between the poor and power
    And the wronged and trodden down
    Blessed the abbots shaven crown

    Gone thank God their wizard spell
    Lost their keys of heaven and hell
    Yet I sigh for men as bold
    As those bearded priests of old

    Now too oft the priesthood wait
    At the threshold of the state
    Waiting for the beck and nod
    Of its power as law and God

    Fraud exults while solemn words
    Sanctify his stolen hoards



    Slavery laughs while ghostly lips
    Bless his manacles and whips

    Not on them the poor rely

    Not to them looks liberty

    Who with fawning falsehood cower

    To the wrong when clothed with power

    Oh to see them meanly cling
    Round the master round the king
    Sported with and sold and bought
    PitifuUer sight is not

    Tell me not that this must be
    Gods true priest is always free
    Free the needed truth to speak
    Right the wronged and raise the weak

    Not to fawn on wealth and state
    Leaving Lazarus at the gate
    Not to peddle creeds like wares
    Not to mutter hireling prayers

    Nor to paint the new lifes bliss
    On the sable ground of this
    Golden streets for idle knave
    Sabbath rest for weary slave

    Not for words and works like these
    Priest of God thy mission is
    But to make earths desert glad
    In its Eden greenness clad

    And to level manhood bring
    Lord and peasant serf and king
    And the Christ of God to find
    In the humblest of thy kind

    Thine to work as well as pray
    Clearing thorny wrongs away
    Plucking up the weeds of sin
    Letting heavens warm sunshine in

    Watching on the hills of Faith
    Listening what the spirit saith
    Of the dimseen light afar
    Growing like a nearing star

    Gods interpreter art thou
    To the waiting ones below
    Twixt them and its light midway
    Heralding the better day

    Catching gleams of temple spires
    Hearing notes of angel choirs

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Where as yet unseen of them
    Comes the New Jerusalem

    Like the seer of Patmos gazing
    On the glory downward blazing
    Till upon Earths grateful sod
    Rests the City of our God



    PAN

    This poem indicates the exultation of the
    antislavery party in view of the revolt of the
    friends of Martin Van Buren in New York from
    the Democratic Presidential nomination in

    1848

    Now joy and thanks forevermore

    The dreary night has wellnigh passed
    The slumbers of the North are oer

    The Giant stands erect at last

    More than we hoped in that dark time
    When faint with watching few and worn

    We saw no welcome daystar climb
    The cold gray pathway of the morn

    O weary hours  O night of years

    What storms our darkling pathway swept
    Where beating back our thronging fears

    By Faith alone our march we kept

    How jeered the scoffing crowd behind
    How mocked before the tyrant train

    As one by one the true and kind
    Fell fainting in our path of pain

    They died their brave hearts breaking slow

    But selfforgetful to the last
    In words of cheer and bugle blow

    Their breath upon the darkness passed

    A mighty host on either hand

    Stood waiting for the dawn of day

    To crush like reeds our feeble band

    The morn has come and where are they

    Troop after troop their line forsakes

    Witli peacewhite banners waving free
    And from our own the glad shout breaks

    Of Freedom and Fraternity

    Like mist before the growing light
    The hostile cohorts melt away

    Our frowning foemen of the night
    Are brothers at the dawn of day



    As unto these repentant ones

    We open wide our toilworn ranks

    Along our line a murmur runs

    Of song and praise and grateful thanks

    Sound for the onset  Blast on blast

    Till Slaverys minions cower and quail
    One charge of fire shall drive them fast

    Like chaff before our Northern gale

    O prisoners in your house of pain

    Dumb toiling millions bound and sold

    Look  stretched oer Southern vale and
    plain
    The Lords delivering hand behold

    Above the tyrants pride of power
    His iron gates and guarded wall

    The bolts which shattered Shinars tower
    Hang smoking for a fiercer fall

    Awake  awake  my Fatherland

    It is thy Northern light that shines
    This stirring march of Freedoms band

    The stormsong of thy mountain pines

    Wake dwellers where the day expires

    And hear in winds that sweep your
    lakes
    And fan your prairies roaring fires

    The signalcall that Freedom makes



    THE CRISIS

    Written on learning the terms of the treaty
    with Mexico

    Across the Stony Mountains oer the des
    erts drouth and sand

    The circles of our empire touch the western
    oceans strand

    From slumberous Timpanogos to Gila wild
    and free

    FloAving down from NuevoLeon to Califor
    nias sea

    And from the mountains of the east to San
    ta Rosas shore

    The eagles of Mexitli shall beat the air no
    more

    O Vale of Rio Bravo  Let thy simple chil
    dren weep

    Close watch about their holy fire let maids
    of Pecos keep



    THE CRISIS



    309



    Let Taos send her cry across Sierra Madres

    pines
    And Santa Barbara toll her bells amidst

    her corn and vines
    For lo  the pale landseekers come with

    eager eyes of gain
    Wide scattering like the bison herds on

    broad Saladas plain

    Let Sacramentos herdsmen heed what

    soimd the winds bring down
    Of footsteps on the crisping snow from

    cold Nevadas crown
    Full hot and fast the Saxon rides with

    rein of travel slack
    And bending oer his saddle leaves the

    sunrise at his back
    By many a lonely river and gorge of fir

    and pine
    On many a wintry liilltop his nightly

    campfires shine

    O countrymen and brothers  that land of

    lake and plain
    Of salt wastes alternating with valleys fat

    with grain
    Of mountains white with winter looking

    downward cold serene
    On their feet with springvines tangled and

    lapped in softest green
    Swift through whose black volcanic gates

    oer many a sunny vale
    Windlike the Arapahoe sweeps the bisons

    dusty trail

    Great spaces yet untravelled great lakes

    whose mystic shores
    The Saxon rifle never heard nor dip of

    Saxon oars
    ireat herds that wander all unwatched

    wild steeds that none have tamed
    Strange fish in unknown streams and birds

    the Saxon never named
    Deep mines dark mountain crucibles

    where Natures chemic powers
    Work out the Great Designers will  all

    these ye say are ours

    Forever onrs  for good or ill on us the

    burden lies
    Gods balance watched by angels is hung

    across the skies
    Shall Justice Truth and Freedom turn

    the poised and trembling scale



    Or shall the Evil triumph and robber

    Wrong prevail
    Shall the broad land oer which our flag in

    starry splendor waves
    Forego through us its freedom and bear

    the tread of slaves

    The day is breaking in the East of which

    the prophets told
    And brightens up the sky of Time the

    Cluistian Age of Gold
    Old Might to Right is yielding battle

    blade to clerkly pen
    Earths monarchs are her peoples and her

    serfs stand up as men
    The isles rejoice together in a day are

    nations born
    And the slave walks free in Timis and by

    Stambouls Golden Horn

    Is this O countrymen of mine  a day for
    ns to sow

    The soil of newgained empire with sla
    verys seeds of woe

    To feed with our fresh lifeblood tlie Old
    Worlds castoff crime

    Dropped like some monstrous early birth
    from the tired lap of Time

    To run anew the evil race the old lost na
    tions ran

    And die like them of unbelief of God and
    wrong of man

    Great Heaven  Is this our mission  End

    in this the prayers and tears
    The toil the strife the watchiugs of our

    younger better years
    Still as the Old World rolls in light shall

    onrs in shadow turn
    A beamless Chaos cursed of God through

    outer darkness borne
    Where the far nations looked for light a

    blackness in the air
    Where for words of hope they listened the

    long wail of despair

    The Crisis presses on us  face to face with
    us it stands

    With solemn lipsi of question like the
    Sphinx in Egypts sands

    This day we fashion Destiny our web of
    Fate we spin

    This day for all hereafter choose we holi
    ness or sin

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Even now from starry Geriziui or Ebals

    cloudy crown
    We call the dews of blessing or the bolts

    of cursing down

    By all for which the martyrs bore their

    agony and shame
    By all the warning words of truth with

    By the Future which awaits us  by all the

    hopes which cast
    Their faint and trembling beams across

    the blackness of the Past
    And by the blessed thought of Him who

    for Earths freedom died
    O my people  O my brothers  let us

    To wed Penobscots waters to San Fran
    ciscos bay

    And bear with Liberty and Law the Bible
    in his train

    The mighty West shall bless the East and
    sea shall answer sea

    LINES ON THE PORTRAIT OF
    A CELEBRATED PUBLISHER

    The lines following were addressed to a
    magazine publisher who alarmed for his
    Southern circulation not only dropped the
    name of Grace Greenwood from his list of con
    tributors but made an offensive parade of his
    action with the view of strengthening his posi
    tion among slaveholders and conservatives
    By some coincidence his portrait was issued
    aboiit the same time

    A MOONY breadth of virgin face

    By thought uuviolated
    A patient mouth to take from scorn

    The hook with banknotes baited
    Its selfcomplacent sleekness shows

    How thrift goes with the fawner
    An unctuous unconcern of all

    Which nice folks call dishonor



    A pleasant print to peddle out

    In lands of rice and cotton
    The model of that face in dough

    Would make the artists fortune
    For Fame to thee has come unsought

    While others vainly woo her
    In proof how mean a thing can make

    A great man of its doer

    To whom shall men thyself compare

    Since common models fail em
    Save classic goose of ancient Rome

    Or sacred ass of Balaam
    The gabble of that wakeful goose

    Saved Rome from sack of Brennus
    The braying of the prophets ass

    Betrayed the angels menace

    So when Guy Fawkes in petticoats

    And azuretinted hose on
    Was twisting from thy lovelorn sheets

    The slowmatch of explosion
    An earthquake blast that would have tossed

    The Union as a feather
    Thy instinct saved a perilled land

    And perilled purse together

    Just think of Carolinas sage

    Sent whirling like a Dervis
    Of Quattlebum in middle air

    Performing strange drillservice
    Doomed like Assyrias lord of old

    Who fell before the Jewess
    Or sad Abimelech to sigh

    Alas  a woman slew us

    Thou sawst beneath a fair disguise

    The danger darkly lurking
    And maiden bodice dreaded more

    Tlian warriors steelwrought jerkin
    How keen to scent the hidden plot

    How jrompt wert thou to balk it
    With patriot zeal and pedler thrift

    For country and for pocket

    Thy likeness here is doubtless well

    But liigher honor s due it
    On auctionblock and negrojail

    Admiring eyes should view it
    Or hung aloft it well miglit grace

    The nations senatechamber
    A greedy Northern bottlefly

    Preserved in Slaverys amber

    DERNE

    The storming of the city of Derne in 1805
    by General Eaton at the head of nine Ameri
    cans forty Greeks and a motley array of Turks
    and Arabs was one of those feats of hardihood
    and daring which have in all ages attracted the
    admiration of the multitude The higher and
    liolier heroism of Christian selfdenial and sac
    rifice in the humble walks of private duty is
    seldom so vvell appreciated

    Night on the city of the Moor

    On mosque and tomb and whitewalled

    shore
    On seawaves to whose ceaseless knock
    The narrow harborgates unlock
    On corsair
    And plundered Christian caraval
    The sounds of Moslem life are still
    No mulebell tinkles down the hill
    Stretched in the broad court of the khan
    The dusty Bornou caravan
    Lies heaped in slumber beast and man
    The Sheik is dreaming in his tent
    erspent
    The kiosk
    The merchant with his wares withdrawn
    Rough pillowed on some pirate breast
    The dancinggirl has sunk to rest
    And save where measured footsteps fall
    Along the Bashaws guarded wall
    Or where like some bad dream the Jew
    Creeps stealthily his quarter through
    Or counts with fear his golden heaps
    The City of the Corsair sleeps

    But where yon prison long and low
    Stands black against the pale starglow
    Chafed by the ceaseless wash of waves
    There watch and pine the Christian slaves
    Roughbearded men whose farofp wives
    Wear out with grief their lonely lives
    And youth still flashing from his eyes
    The clear blue of New England skies
    A treasured lock of whose soft hair
    Now wakes some sorrowing mother

    prayer
    Or worn upon some maiden breast
    s unrest

    A bitter cup each life must drain
    The groaning earth is cursed with pain
    And like the scroll the angel bore
    The shuddering Hebrew seer before



    O
    With all the woes which follow sin
    But bitterest of the ills beneath
    Whose load man totters down to death
    Is that which plucks the regal crown
    Of Freedom from his forehead down
    And snatches from his powerless hand
    The sceptred sign of selfcommand
    Effacing with the chain and rod
    The image and the seal of God
    Till from his nature day by day
    The manly virtues fall away
    And leave him naked blind and mute
    The godlike merging in the brute

    Why mourn the quiet ones who die
    Beneath affections tender eye
    Unto their household and their kin
    Like ripened cornsheaves gathered in
    O weeper from that tranquil sod
    That holy harvesthome of God
    Turn to the quick and suffering shed
    Thy tears upon the living dead
    Thank God above thy dear ones
    They sleep with Him they are not slaves

    What dark mass down the mountainsides

    Swiftpouring like a stream divides

    A long loose straggling caravan

    Camel and horse and armed man

    The moons low crescent glimmering o

    Its grave of waters to the shore

    Lights up that mountain cavalcade

    And gleams from gnn and spear and blade

    er them falls

    The shadow of the city walls

    Hark to the sentry

    In the fierce trumpets charging sound

    The rush of men the musket

    The short sharp clang of meeting steel

    Vain JMoslem vain thy lifeblood poured
    s sword
    Not to the swift nor to the strong
    The battles of the right belong
    For he who strikes for Freedom wears
    The armor of the captive
    And Nature proffers to his cause
    The strength of her eternal laws
    While he whose arm essays to bind
    And herd with common brutes his kind
    Strives evermore at fearful odds
    With Nature and the jealous gods
    And dares the dread recoil which late
    Or soon their right shall vindicate

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    T is done the horned crescent falls
    The starflag flouts the broken walls
    Joy to the captive husband  joy
    To thy sick heart O brownlocked boy
    In sullen wrath the conquered Moor
    Wide open flings your dungeondoor
    And leaves ye free from cell and chain
    The owners of yoiuselves again
    Dark as his allies desertborn
    Soiled with the battle
    With the long marches of his band
    Through hottest wastes of rock and sand
    Scorched by the sun and furnacebreath
    Of the red deserts wind of death
    With welcome words and grasping hands
    The victor and deliverer stands

    The tale is one of distant skies

    The dust of half a century lies

    Upon it  yet its hero

    Still lingers on the lips of Fame

    Men speak the praise of him who gave

    s slave

    Yet dare to brand with shame and crime

    The heroes of oiir land and time

    The selfforgetful ones who stake

    Home name and life for Freedom

    God mend his heart who cannot feel

    The impulse of a holy zeal

    And sees not with his sordid eyes

    The beauty of selfsacrifice

    Though in the sacred place he stands

    Uplifting consecrated hands

    Unworthy are his lips to tell

    Of Jesus martyrmiracle

    Or name aright that dread embrace

    Of suffering for a fallen race



    A SABBATH SCENE

    This poem finds its justification in the readi
    ness with which even in the North clergymen
    urged the prompt execution of the Fugitive
    Slave Law as a Christian duty and defended
    the system of slavery as a Bible institution

    Scarce had the solemn Sabbathbell
    Ceased quivering in the steeple

    Scarce had the parson to his desk
    Walked stately through his people

    When down the summershaded street

    A wasted female figure
    With dusky brow and naked feet

    Came rushing wild and eager



    She saw the white spire through the trees
    She heard the sweet hymn swelling

    pitying Christ  a refuge give
    That poor one in Thy dwelling

    Like a scared fawn before the hounds

    Right up the aisle she glided
    While close behind her whip in hand

    A lankhaired hunter strided

    She raised a keen and bitter cry
    To Heaven and Earth appealing

    Were manhood
    Had womans heart no feeling

    A score of stout hands rose between

    The liunter and the flying
    Age clenched his staff and maiden eyes

    Flashed tearful yet defying

    Who dares profane this house and day

    Cried out the angry pastor
    Why bless your soul the wench s a
    slave

    And I m her lord and master

    I
    And who shall dare refuse me

    Down came the parson bowing low
    My good sir pxay excuse me

    Of course I know your right divine
    To own and work and whip her

    Quick deacon throw that Pol3glott
    Before the wench and trip her

    Plump dropped the holy tome and o

    Its sacred pages stumbling
    Bound hand and foot a slave once more

    The hapless wretch lay trembling

    1 saw the parson tie the knots
    The while his flock addressing

    Tlie Scriptural claims of slavery
    With text on text impressing

    Although said he  on Sabbath day

    All secular occupations
    Are deadly sins we must fulfil

    Our moral obligations

    And this commends itself as one

    To every conscience tender
    As Paul sent back Onesiuuis

    My Christian friends we send her



    IN THE EVIL DAYS



    33



    Shriek rose on shriek  the Sabbath air
    Her wild cries tore asunder

    I listened with hushed breath to hear
    God answering with his thunder

    s cloth

    Had smothered down her shrieking

    And dumb she turned from face to face
    For human pity seeking

    I saw her dragged along the aisle
    Her shackles harshly clanking

    I heard the parson over all
    The Lord devoutly thanking

    My brain took fire   Is this I cried
    The end of prayer and preaching

    Then down with puljiit down with priest
    And give us Natures teaching

    Foul shame and scorn be on ye all

    Who turn the good to evil
    And steal the Bible from the Lord

    To give it to the Devil

    Than garbled text or parchment law

    I own a statute higher
    And God is true though every book

    And every man s a liar

    Just then I felt the deacon
    In wrath my coattail seize on

    I heard the priest cry  Infidel
    The lawyer mutter  Treason

    I started up  where now were church
    Slave master priest and people

    I only heard the supperbell
    Instead of clanging steeple

    s sill

    O

    The pages of a good old Book
    The wind of summer lifted

    And flower and vine like angel wings

    Around the Holy Mother
    s truth

    And Mercy kissed each other

    And freely from the cherrybough
    Above the casement swinging

    With golden bosom to the sun
    The oriole was singing



    As bird and flower made plain of old

    The lesson of the Teacher
    So now I heard the written Word

    Interpreted by Nature

    For to my ear methought the breeze
    Bore Freedom

    Thus saith the Lord  Break every yoke
    Undo the heavy burden



    IN THE EVIL DAYS

    This and the four following poems have
    special reference to that darkest hour in the
    aggression of slavery which preceded the dawn
    of a better day when the conscience of the
    people was roused to action Originally en
    titled Stanzas for the Times 1850

    The evil days have come the poor

    Are made a prey
    Bar up the hospitable door
    Put out the firelights point no more

    The wanderers way

    For Pity now is crime  the chain

    Which binds our States
    Is melted at her hearth in twain
    Is rusted by her tears

    Close up her gates

    Our Union like a glacier stirred

    By voice below
    Or bell of kine or wing of bird
    A beggars crust a kindly word

    May overthrow

    Poor whispering tremblers  yet we boast

    Our blood and name
    Bursting its centurybolted frost
    Each gray cairn on the Northman

    Ciies out for shame

    Oh for the open firmament

    The prairie free
    The desert hillside cavernrent
    The Pawnees lodge the Aiab

    The Bushmans tree

    Than web of Persian loom most rare

    Or soft divan
    Better the rough rock bleak and bare
    Or hollow tree which man may share

    With sufferinjr man

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    I hear a voice

    Let Love be dumb
    Clasping her liberal hands in awe
    Let sweetlipped Charity withdraw

    From hearth and home

    I hear another voice

    Are thine to feed
    Turn not the outcast from thy door
    Nor give to bonds and wrong once more

    Whom God hath freed

    Dear Lord  between that law and Thee

    No choice remains
    Yet not untrue to man
    Though spurning its rewards is he

    Who bears its pains

    Not mine Seditions trumpetblast

    And threatening word
    I read the lesson of the Past
    That firm endurance wins at last

    More than the sword

    O cleareyed Faith and Patience thou

    So calm and strong
    Lend strength to weakness teach us how
    The sleepless eyes of God look through

    This night of wrong



    MOLOCH IN STATE STREET

    In a footnote of the Report of the Senate of
    Massachusetts on the case of the arrest and
    return to bondage of the fugitive slave Thomas
    Sims it is stated that

    It would have been impossible for the
    U S marshal thus successfully to have resisted
    the law of the State without the assistance
    of the municipal authorities of Boston and
    the countenance and support of a numerous
    wealthy and powerful body of citizens It was
    in evidence that 1500 of the most wealthy and
    respectable citizens  merchants bankers and
    others  volunteered their services to aid the
    marshal on this occasion    No watch was
    kept iipou the doings of the marshal and while
    the State officers slept after the moon had
    gone down in the darkest liour before day
    break the accused was taken out of our juris
    diction by the armed police of the city of
    Boston
    The moon has set  while yet the dawn

    Breaks cold and gray
    Between the midnight and the morn
    Bear off your prey



    On swift and still  the conscious street

    Is panged and stirred
    Tread light  that fall of serried feet

    The dead have heard

    The first diawn blood of Freedoms veins

    Gushed where ye tread
    Lo  through the dusk the martyrstains

    Blush darkly red

    Beneath the slowlywaning stars

    And whitening day
    What stern and awful presence bars

    That sacred way

    What faces frown upon ye dark

    With shanae and pain
    Come these from Plymouths Pilgrim bark

    Is that young Vane

    Who dimly beckoning speed ye on

    With mocking cheer
    Lo  spectral Andros Hutchinson

    And Gage are here

    For ready mart or favoring blast

    Through Molochs fire
    Flesh of his flesh unsparing passed

    The Tyrian sire

    Ye make that ancient sacrifice

    Of Man to Gain
    Your traffic thrives where Freedom dies

    Beneath the chain

    Ye sow today  your harvest scorn

    And hate is near
    How think ye freemen mountainborn

    The tale will hear

    Thank God  our mother State can yet

    Her fame retrieve
    To you and to your children let

    The scandal cleave

    Chain Hall and Pulpit Court and Press

    Make gods of gold
    Let honor truth and manliness

    THE RENDITION

    n the 2d of June 1854 Anthony Bums a
    fugitive slave from Virginia after being under
    arrest for ten days in the Boston Court House
    was remanded to slavery under the Fugitive
    Slave Act and taken down State Street to a
    steamer chartered by the United States Gov
    ernment under guard of United States troops
    and artillery Massachusetts militia and Boston
    police Public excitement ran liigh a futile
    attempt to rescue Burns having been made
    during his confinement and the streets were
    crowded with tens of thousands of people of
    whom many came from other towns and cities
    of the State to witness the humiliating spec
    tacle

    I HEARD the trains shrill whistle call

    I SAID I stood upon thy grave

    My Mother State wlien last the moon
    Of blossoms clomb the skies of June

    And scattering ashes on my head
    I wore undreaming of relief
    The sackcloth of thy shame and grief

    Again that moon of blossoms shines
    On leaf and flower and folded wing
    And thou hast risen with the spring



    Once more thy strong maternal arms
    Are round about thy children flung
    A lioness that guards her young

    No threat is on thy closed lips
    But in thine eye a power to smite
    The mad wolf backward from its light

    Southward the baffled robber
    Henceforth runs only  hereaway
    The fell lycanthrope finds no prey

    Henceforth within thy sacred gates

    His first low howl shall downward draw
    The thunder of thy righteous law

    Not mindless of thy trade and gain
    But acting on the wiser plan
    Thou rt grown conservative of man

    So shaft thou clothe with life the hope
    Dreampainted on the sightless eyes
    Of him who sang of Paradise

    The vision of a Christian man
    In virtue as in stature great
    Embodied in a Christian State

    And thou amidst thy sisterhood
    Forbearing long yet standing fast
    Shalt win their grateful thanks at last

    When North and South shall strive nc
    more
    And all their feuds and fears be lost
    In Freedom



    THE HASCHISH

    Of all that Orient lands can vaunt
    Of marvels with our own competing

    The strangest is the Haschish plant
    And what will follow on its eating

    What pictures to the taster rise
    Of Dervish or of Almeh dances

    Of Eblis or of Paradise

    Set all aglow with Houri glances

    The poppy visions of Cathay

    The heavy beertrance of the Suabian
    The wizard lights and demon play

    Of nights Walpurgis and Arabian

    THE KANSAS EMIGRANTS

    This poem and the three following were
    called out by the popular movement of Free
    State men to occupy the territory of Kansas
    and by the use of the great democratic weapoii
    an overpowering majority  to settle the



    conflict on that ground between Freedom and
    Slavery The opponents of the movement
    used another kind of weapon This song was
    sent to the first company of emigrants by the
    poet  It is one of those prophecies says
    E E Hale
    before the event and not after In absolute
    hard fact the song was sung by parties of em
    igrants sung when they started sung as they
    rode and sung in the new home

    We cross the prairie as of old

    The pilgrims crossed the sea
    To make the West as they the East

    We re flowing from our native hills

    The blessing of our Motherlaud

    We go to plant her common schools

    The music of her bells

    Upbearing like the Ark of old

    LETTER

    FROM A MISSIONARY OF THE METHO
    DIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH SOUTH IN
    KANSAS TO A DISTINGUISHED POLI
    TICIAN

    Douglas Mission August 1854

    Last week  the Lord be praised for

    all His mercies
    To His unworthy servant   I arrived
    Safe at the Mission via Westport where
    I tarried over night to aid in forming
    A Vigilance Committee to send back
    In shirts of tar and featherdoublets

    quilted
    With forty stripes save one all Yankee

    comers



    Uncircumcised and Gentile aliens from
    The Commonwealth of Israel who despise
    The prize of the high calling of the saints
    Who plant amidst this heathen wilderness
    Pure gospel institutions sanctified
    By patriarchal use The meeting opened
    With prayer as was most fitting Half

    an hour
    Or thereaway I groaned and strove and

    wrestled
    As Jacob did at Peiinel till the power
    Fell on the people and they cried

    Amen
    Glory to God   and stamped and

    clapped their hands
    And the rough river boatmen wiped their

    eyes
    Go it old hoss   they cried and cursed

    the niggers
    Fulfilling thus the word of prophecy
    Cursed be Canaan After prayer the

    meeting
    Chose a committee  good and pious

    men
    A Presbyterian Elder Baptist deacon
    A local preacher three or four classleaders
    Anxious inquirers and renewed back
    sliders
    A score in all  to watch the river ferry
    As they of old did watch the fords of

    Jordan
    And cut off all whose Yankee tongues re
    fuse
    The Shibboleth of the Nebraska bill
    And then in answer to repeated calls
    I gave a brief account of what I saw
    In Washington  and truly many hearts
    Rejoiced to know the President and you
    And all the Cabinet regularly hear
    The gospel message of a Sunday morning
    Drinking with thirsty souls of the sincere
    Milk of the Word Glory  Amen and
    Selah

    Here at the Mission all things have

    gone well
    The brother who throughout my absence

    acted
    As overseer assures me that the crops
    Never were better I have lost one negro
    A firstrate hand but obstinate and sullen
    He rn away some time last spxing and

    hid

    Found him and treed and shot him For

    the rest
    The heathens round about begin to feel
    The influence of our pious ministrations
    And works of love  and some of them al
    ready
    Have purchased negroes and are settling

    down
    the Lord for

    this
    I know it will rejoice you You I hear
    Are on the eve of visiting Chicago
    To fight with the wild beasts of Ephesus
    Long John and Dutch FreeSoilers May

    your arm
    Be clothed with strength and on your

    tongue be found
    The sweet oil of persuasion So desires
    Your brother and colaborer Amen

    P S All
    these lines
    The Yankee abolitionists are coming
    Upon us like a flood  grim stalwart men
    Each face set like a flint of Plymouth Rock
    Against our institutions  staking out
    Their farm lots on the wooded Wakarusa
    Or squatting by the mellow  bottomed

    Kansas
    The pioneers of mightier multitudes
    The small rain patter ere the thunder

    shower
    Drowns the dry prairies Hope from man

    is not
    Oh for a quiet berth at Washington
    Snug naval chaplaincy or clerkship where
    These rumors of free labor and free soil
    Might never meet me more Better to be
    Doorkeeper in the White House than to

    dwell
    Amidst these Yankee tents that whiten
    ing show
    On the green prairie like a fleet becalmed
    Methinks I hear a voice come up the river
    From those far bayous where the alligators
    Mount guard around the camping filibus
    ters
    Shake off the dust of Kansas Turn to

    Cuba
    That golden orange just about to fall
    Oerripe into the Democratic lap
    Keep pace with Pro
    Manifest destiny Go forth and follow
    ne

    There niay

    BURIAL OF BARBER

    Thomas Barber was shot December 6 1855
    near Lawrence Kansas

    Bear him comrades to his grave
    Never over one more brave

    Shall the prairie grasses weep
    In the ages yet to come
    When the millions in our room

    What we sow in tears shall reap

    Bear him up the icy hill
    With the Kansas frozen still

    As his noble heart below
    And the land he came to till
    With a freemans thews and will

    And his poor hut roofed with snow

    One more look of that dead face
    Of his murder

    One more kiss O widowed one
    Lay your left hands on his brow
    Lift your right hands up and vow

    That his work shall yet be done

    Patience friends  The eye of God
    Every path by Murder trod

    Watches lidless day and night
    And the dead man in his shroud
    And his widow weeping loud

    And our hearts are in His sight

    Every deadly threat that swells
    With the roar of gambling hells

    Every brutal jest and jeer
    Every wicked thought and plan
    Of the cruel heart of man

    Though but whispered He can hear

    We in suffering they in crime
    Wait the just award of time

    Wait the vengeance that is due
    Not in vain a heart shall break
    Not a tear for Freedoms sake

    Fall unheeded  God is true

    While the flag with stars bedecked
    Threatens where it should protect

    And the Law shakes hands with Crime
    What is left us but to wait
    Match our patience to our fate

    And abide the better time

    Patience friends  The human heart
    Everywhere shall take our part

    Everywhere for us shall pray
    On our side are nature
    And Gods life is in the cause

    That we suffer for today

    Well to suffer is divine

    Pass the watchword down the line

    Pass the countersign
    Not to him who rashly dares
    But to him who nobly bears

    Is the victor

    Frozen earth to frozen breast
    Lay our slain one down to rest

    Lay him down in hope and faith
    And above the broken sod
    Once again to Freedoms God

    Pledge ourselves for life or death

    That the State whose walls we lay
    In our blood and tears today

    Shall be free from bonds of shame
    And our goodly land untrod
    By the feet of Slavery shod

    With cursing as with flame

    Plant the Buckeye on his grave
    For the hunter of the slave

    In its shadow cannot rest
    And let martyr mound and tree
    Be our pledge and guaranty

    Of the freedom of the West 1

    Across thy Alleghanian chain
    With groanings from a land in pain

    The crying of thy children

    To ruin or to save
    To wound or heal to blight or bless

    Then let thy virtue match the crime
    Rise to a level with the time

    LE MARAIS DU CYGNE

    The massacre of unarmed and unoffending
    men in Southern Kansas in May 1858 took
    place near the Marais du Cygne of the French
    voyageurs

    A BLUSH as of roses

    Where rose never grew
    Great drops on the bunchgrass

    But not of the dew
    A taint in the sweet air

    For wild bees to shun I
    A stain that shall never

    Bleach out in the sun

    Back steed of the prairies

    Sweet songbird fly back I
    Wheel hither bald vulture

    Gray wolf call thy pack
    The foul human vultures

    Have feasted and fled
    The wolves of the Border

    Have crept from the dead

    From the hearths of their cabins

    The fields of their corn
    Unwarned and unweaponed

    The victims were torn



    THE PASS OF THE SIERRA



    321



    By the whirlwind of murder
    Swooped ujj and swept on

    To the low reedy fenlands
    The Marsh of the Swan

    With a vain plea for mercy

    No stout knee was crooked
    In the mouths of the rifles

    Right manly they looked
    How paled the May sunshine

    O Marais du Cygne
    On death for the strong life

    On red grass for green

    In the homes of their rearing

    Yet warm mth their lives
    Ye wait the dead only

    Poor children and wives
    Put out the red forgefire

    The smith shall not come
    Unyoke the brown oxen

    The ploughman lies dumb

    s Marsh

    O dreary deathtrain
    With pressed lips as bloodless

    As lips of the slain
    Kiss down the young eyelids

    Smooth down the gray hairs
    Let tears quench the curses

    That burn through your prayers

    Strong man of the prairies

    Mourn bitter and wild
    Wail desolate woman

    Weep fatherless child
    But the grain of God springs up

    From ashes beneath
    And the crown of his harvest

    Is life out of death

    Not in vain on the dial

    The shade moves along
    To point the great contrasts

    Of riglit and of wrong
    Free homes and free altars

    Free prairie and flood
    The reeds of the Swan

    Whose bloom is of blood

    On the lintels of Kansas
    That blood shall not dry

    Henceforth the Bad Angel
    Shall harmless go by



    Henceforth to the simset
    Unchecked on her way

    Shall Liberty follow
    The march of the day



    THE PASS OF THE SIERRA

    All night above their rocky bed
    They saw the stars march slow

    The wild Sierra overhead
    The deserts death below

    The Indian from his lodge of bark
    The gray bear from his den

    Beyond their campfire
    Glared on the mountain men

    Still upward turned with anxious strain

    Their leaders sleepless eye
    Where splinters of the mountain chain

    Stood black against the sky

    The night waned slow  at last a glow

    A gleam of sudden fire
    Shot up behind the walls of snow

    And tipped each icy spire

    Up men  he criefl

    Today please God we 11 pass
    And look from Winters frozen throne



    On Summers flowers and



    grass



    They set their faces to the blast
    They trod the eternal snow

    And faint worn bleeding hailed at last
    The promised land below

    Behind they saw the snowcloud tossed

    By many an icy horn
    Before warm valleys woodembossed

    And green with vines and corn

    They left the Winter at their backs

    To flap his baffled wing
    And downward with the cataracts

    Leaped to the lap of Spring

    Strong leader of that mountain band

    Another task remains
    To break from Slaverys desert land

    A path to Freedoms plains

    The winds are wild the way is drear
    Yet flashing through the night

    A SONG FOR THE TIME

    Written in the summer of 1856 during the
    political campaign of the Free Soil party under
    the candidacy of John C Fremont

    Up laggards of Freedom   our free flag

    is cast
    To the blaze of the sun and the wings of

    the blast
    Will ye turn from a struggle so bravely

    begun
    From a foe that is breaking a field that s

    half won

    Whoso loves not his kind and who fears

    not the Lord
    Let him join that foes service accursed and

    abhorred
    Let him do his base will as the slave only

    can
    Let him put on the bloodhound and put off

    the Man

    Let him go where the cold blood that creeps

    in his veins
    Shall stiffen the slavewhip and rust on his

    chains
    Where the black slave shall laugh in his

    bonds to behold
    The White Slave beside him selffettered

    and sold

    But ye who still boast of hearts beating
    and warm

    Rise from lake shore and oceans like
    waves in a storm

    Come throng round our banner in Libertys
    name

    Like winds from your mountains like prai
    ries aflame

    Our foe hidden long in his ambush of night
    Now forced from his covert stands black
    in the light



    Oh the cruel to Man and the hateful to

    God
    Smite him down to the earth that is cursed

    where he trod

    For deeper than thunder of summers loud

    shower
    On the dome of the sky God is striking the

    hour
    Shall we falter before what we ve prayed

    for so long
    When the Wrong is so weak and the Right

    is so strong

    Come forth all together  come old and come
    young

    Freedoms vote in each hand and her song
    on each tongue

    Truth naked is stronger than Falsehood in
    mail

    The Wrong cannot prosper the Right can
    not fail

    Like leaves of the summer once numbered

    the foe
    But the hoarfrost is falling the northern

    winds blow
    Like leaves of November erelong shall they

    fall
    For earth wearies of them and God s over

    Written during the stirring weeks when the
    great political battle for Freedom under Fre
    monts leadership was permitting strong hope
    of success  a hope overshadowed and solem
    nized by a sense of the magnitude of the bar
    baric evil and a forecast of the wiscrupulous
    and desperate use of all its powers in the last
    and decisive struggle

    A SOUND of tumult troubles all the air
    Like the low thunders of a sultry sky
    Farrolling ere the downright lightnings
    glare

    The hills blaze red with warnings  foes

    draw nigh
    Treading the dark with challenge and
    reply
    Behold the burden of the prophets vision
    The gathering hosts  the Valley of Deci
    sion



    THE PANORAMA



    Z2



    Dusk with the wings of eagles wheeling
    oer
    Day of the Lord of darkness and not
    light
    It breaks in thunder and the whirlwinds
    roar
    Even so Father  Let Thy will be done
    Turn and oerturn end what Thou hast be
    gun
    In judgment or in mercy  as for me
    If but the least and frailest let me be
    Evermore numbered with the truly free
    Who find Thy service perfect liberty
    I fain would thank Thee that my mortal
    life
    Has reached the hour albeit through care
    and pain
    When Good and Evil as for final strife
    Close dim and vast on Armageddons
    plain
    And Michael and his angels once again
    Drive howling back the Spirits of the
    Night
    Oh for the faith to read the signs aright
    And from the angle of Thy perfect sight
    See Truths white banner floating on be
    fore
    And the Good Cause despite of venal

    friends
    And base expedients move to noble ends
    See Peace with Freedom make to Time
    amends
    And through its cloud of dust the thresh
    ingfloor
    Flailed by the thunder heaped with
    chaffless grain



    A SONG

    INSCRIBED TO THE FREMONT CLUBS

    Written after the election in 1856 which
    showed the immense gains of the Free Soil
    party and insured its success in 1860

    Beneath thy skies November

    Thy skies of cloud and rain
    Arotmd our blazing camptires
    We close our ranks again
    Then sound again the bugles
    Call the musterroll anew
    If months have wellnigh won the field
    What may not four years do



    For God be praised  New England
    Takes once more her ancient place

    Again the Pilgrims banner

    Leads the vanguard of the race
    Then sound again the bugles etc

    Along the lordly Hudson

    A shout of triumph breaks
    The Empire State is speaking

    From the ocean to the lakes

    Then sound again the bugles etc

    The Northern hills are blazing
    The Northern skies are bright

    And the fair young West is turning
    Her forehead to the light

    Then sound again the bugles etc

    Push every outpost nearer

    Press hard the hostile towers
    Another Balaklava

    And the Malakoff is ours
    Then sound again the buglea
    Call the musterroll anew
    If months have wellnigh won the field
    What may not four years do



    THE PANORAMA

    Written with a view to political effect in
    the Presidential campaign of 1856 It was
    read by T Starr King at the opening of a
    course of lectures on slavery delivered in Bos
    ton at that time

    Archdeacon Barbour

    Through the long hall the shuttered

    windows shed
    A dubious light on every upturned head
    On locks like those of Absalom the fair
    On the bald apex ringed with scanty hair
    On blank indifference and on curious stare
    On the pale Showman reading from his

    stage
    The hieroglyphics of that facial page
    Half sad lialf scornful listening to the

    bruit
    Of restless canetap and impatient foot

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    And the shrill call across the general din
    Roll up your curtain  Let the show be
    gin

    At length a murmur like the winds that
    break
    Into green waves the prairie
    Deepened and swelled to music clear and

    loud
    And as the westwind lifts a summer cloud
    The curtain rose disclosing wide and far
    A green land stretching to the evening star
    Fair rivers skirted by primeval trees
    And flowers hummed over by the desert

    bees
    Marked by tall bluffs whose slopes of green
    ness show
    Fantastic outcrops of the rock below
    s pains
    And plastic fingering of her sun and rains
    Arch tower and gate grotesquely win
    dowed hall
    And long escarpment of half  crumbled

    wall
    Huger than those which from steep hills

    of vine
    Stare through their loopholes on the trav
    elled Rhine
    Suggesting vaguely to the gazer
    A fancy idle as the prairie wind
    Of the lands dwellers in an age unguessed
    The unsung Jotuns of the mystic West

    Beyond the prairie
    pass

    The Tartars marvels of his Land of Grass

    Vast as the sky against whose sunset shores

    Wave after wave the billowy greenness
    pours

    And onward still like islands in that
    main

    Loom the rough peaks of many a mountain
    chain

    Whence east and west a thousand waters
    run

    From winter lingering under summer

    And still beyond long lines of foam and
    sand

    Tell where Pacific rolls his waves aland

    From many a widelapped port and land
    locked bay

    s
    highway

    To Indian isles of spice and marts of far
    Cathay



    Such said the showman as the cur
    tain fell
    Is the new Canaan of our Israel
    The land of promise to the swarming North
    Which hivelike sends its annual surplus

    forth
    To the poor Southron on his wornout soil
    Scathed by the curses of unnatural toil
    To Europes exiles seeking home and rest
    And the lank nomads of the wandering

    West
    Who asking neither in their love of change
    And the free bisons amplitude of range
    Rear the loghut for present shelter meant
    Not future comfort like an Arabs tent

    Then spake a shrewd onlooker
    said he
    I like your picture but I fain would see
    A sketch of what your promised land will

    be
    When with electric nerve and fierybrained
    With Natures forces to its chariot chained
    The future grasping by the past obeyed
    The twentieth century rounds a new de
    cade

    Then said the Showman sadly

    who grieves
    Over the scattering of the sibyls leaves
    Unwisely mourns Suffice it that we know
    What needs must ripen from the seeds we

    sow
    That present time is but the mould wherein
    We cast the shapes of holiness and sin
    A painful watcher of the passing hour
    Its lust of gold its strife for place and

    power
    Its lack of manhood honor reverence

    truth
    Wisethoughted age and generoushearted

    youth
    Nor yet unmindful of each better sign
    The low far lights which on th horizon

    shine
    Like those which sometimes tremble on the

    rim
    Of clouded skies when day is closing dim
    Flashing athwart the purple spears of rain
    The hope of sunshine on the hills again
    I need no prophets word nor shapes thrt

    pass
    Like clouding shadows oer a magic glass
    For now as ever passionless and cold
    Doth the dread angel of the future hold



    THE PANORAMA



    325



    Evil and good before us with no voice

    Or warning look to guide us in our choice

    With spectral hands outreachiug through

    the gloom
    The shadowy contrasts of the coming doom
    Transferred from these it now remains to

    give
    The sun and shade of Fates alternative

    Then witli a burst of music touching

    all
    The keys of thrifty life  the millstream

    fall
    The engines pant along its quivering rails
    Tlie anvil
    s whistled

    tune
    Answering the summons of the bells of noon
    The woodman
    The steamboats signal and the dip of oars
    Slowly the curtain rose from off a land
    Fair as God
    The golden wheatfields glimmered in the

    sun
    And the tall maize its yellow tassels spun
    Smooth highways set with hedgerows liv
    ing green
    With steepled towns thiougli shaded vistas

    seen
    The schoolhouse murmuring with its hive
    like swarm
    s

    storm
    The painted farmhouse shining through the

    leaves
    Of fruited orchards bending at its eaves
    Where live again around the Western

    hearth
    The homely oldtime virtues of the North
    Where the blithe housewife rises with the

    day
    And wellpaid labor counts his task a play
    And grateful tokens of a Bible free
    And the free Gospel of Hmnanity
    Of diverse sects and differing names the

    shrines
    One in their faith whate

    signs
    Like varying strophes of the same sweet

    hymn
    From many a prairies swell and river

    brim
    A thousand churchspires sanctify the air
    Of the calm Sabbath with their sign of

    prayer



    Like sudden nightfall over bloom and
    green
    The curtain dropped  and momently be
    tween
    The clank of fetter and the crack of thong
    Half sob half laughter music swept along
    A strange refrain whose idle words and low
    Like drunken mourners kept the time of

    woe
    As if the revellers at a masquerade
    Heard in the distance funeral marches

    played
    Such music dashing all his smiles with tears
    The thoughtful voyager on Fontchartrain

    hears
    Where through the noonday dusk of

    wooded shores
    The negro boatman singing to his oars
    With a wild pathos borrowed of his wrong
    Redeems the jaigon of his senseless song
    Look said the Showman sternly as he

    rolled
    His curtain upward
    hold

    A village straggling in loose disarray
    Of vulgar newness premature decay
    A tavern crazy with its whiskey brawls
    With

    walls
    Without surrounded by a motley crowd
    The shrewdeyed salesman garrulous and

    loud
    A squire or colonel in his pride of place
    Known at free fights the caucus and the

    race
    Prompt to proclaim his honor without blot
    And silence doubters with a tenpace shot
    s rant
    With pious phrase and democratic cant
    Yet never scrupling with a filthy jest
    To sell the infant from its mother
    Break through all ties of wedlock home

    and kin
    Yield shrinking girlhood up to graybeard

    sin
    Sell all the virtues with his human stock
    The Christian graces on his auctionblock
    And coolly count on shrewdest bargains

    driven
    In hearts regenerate and in souls forgiven

    Look once again  The moving canvas
    shows
    A slave plantations slovenly repose

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Where in rude cabins rotting midst their
    weeds

    The human chattel eats and sleeps and
    breeds

    And held a brute in practice as in law

    Becomes in fact the thing he

    There early summoned to the hemp and
    corn

    The nursing mother leaves her child new
    born

    There haggard sickness weak and deathly
    faint

    Crawls to his task and fears to make com
    plaint

    And sadeyed Rachels childless in decay

    Weep for their lost ones sold and torn
    away

    s dwelling stands

    In shabby keeping with his halftilled lands

    The gates unhinged the yard with weeds
    unclean

    The ciacked veianda with a tipsy lean

    Without loosescattered like a wreck adrift

    Signs of misrule and tokens of uuthrift

    Within profusion to discomfort joined

    The listless body and the vacant mind

    The fear the hate the theft and falsehood
    born

    In menial hearts of toil and stripes and
    scorn

    There all the vices which like birds ob
    scene

    Batten on slavery loathsome and unclean

    From the foul kitchen to the parlor rise

    Pollute the nursery where the childheir
    lies

    Taint infant lips beyond all after cure

    With the fell poison of a breast impure

    Touch boyhood
    flame

    From girlhoods instincts steal the blush of
    shame

    So swells from low to high from weak to
    strong

    The tragic chorus of the baleful wrong

    Guilty or guiltless all within its range

    Feel the blind justice of its sure revenge

    Still scenes like these the moving chart

    reveals
    Up the long western steppes the blighting

    steals
    Down the Pacific slope the evil Fate
    Glides like a shadow to the Golden Gate
    From sea to sea the drear eclipse is thrown



    From sea to sea the Mauvaises Terres have

    grown
    A belt of curses on the New World

    The curtain fell All drew a freer breath
    As men are wont to do when mournful death
    Is covered from their sight The Showman

    stood
    s attitude
    One moment then with sudden gesture

    shook
    His loose hair back and with the air and

    look
    Of one who felt beyond the narrow stage
    And listening grouj the presence of the

    age
    And heard the footsteps of the things to be
    Poured out his soul in earnest words and

    free

    O friends   he said
    of paint
    You see the semblance incomplete and

    faint
    Of the twofronted Futiue which today
    Stands dim and silent waiting in your way
    Today your servant subject to your will
    Tomorrow master or for good or ill
    If the dark face of Slavery on you turns
    If the mad curse its paper barrier spurns
    If the world granary of the West is made
    The last foul market of the slavers trade
    Why rail at fate  The mischief is your

    own
    Why hate your neighbor  Blame your
    selves alone

    Men of the North  The South you

    charge with wrong
    Is weak and poor while you are rich and

    strong
    If questions  idle and absurd as those
    The oldtime monks and Paduan doctors

    chose
    Mere ghosts of questions tariffs and dead

    banks
    And scarecrow pontiffs never broke your

    ranks
    Your thews united could at once roll back
    Tiie jostled nation to its primal track
    Nay were you simply steadfast manly just
    True to the faith your fathers left in trust
    If stainless honor outweighed in your scale
    A codfish quintal or a factory bale
    Full many a noble heart and such remain

    111 all the South like Lot in Sicldim

    s

    Keep white and pure their chastity of soul

    Now sick to loathing of your weak com
    plaints

    Your tricks as sinners and yoiir prayers as
    saints

    Would halfway meet the frankness of your
    tone

    And feel their pulses beating with your



    The North  the South  no geographic

    line
    Can fix the boundary or the point define
    Since each with each so closely iuterblends
    Where Slavery rises and where Freedom

    ends
    Beneath your rocks the roots farreaching

    hide
    Of the fell Upas on the Southern side
    The tree whose branches in your north winds

    wave
    Dropped its young blossoms 011 Movmt

    Vernons grave
    The nursing growth of Monticellos crest
    Is now the glory of the free Northwest
    To the wise maxims of her olden school
    Virginia listened from thy lips Rantoul
    Sewards words of power and Sumners

    fresh renown
    Flow from the pen that Jefferson laid down
    And when at length her years of madness

    oer
    Like the crowned grazer on Euphrates

    shore
    From her long lapse to savagery her moiith
    Bitter with baneful herbage turns the

    South
    Resumes her old attire and seeks to smooth
    Her unkempt tresses at the glass of truth
    Her early faith shall find a tongue again
    New Wythes and Pinckneys swell that old

    refrain
    Her sons with yours renew the ancient

    pact
    The myth of Union prove at last a fact
    Then if one murmur mars the wide con
    tent
    Some Northern lip will drawl the last dis
    sent
    Some Unionsaving patriot of your own
    Lament to find liis occupation gone



    Grant that the North
    scorned betrayed
    Oerreached in bargains with her neighbor

    made
    When selfish thrift and party held the scales
    For peddling dicker not for honest sales
    Whom shall we strike  Who most de
    serves our blame
    The braggart Southron open in his aim
    And bold as wicked crashing straight

    through all
    That bars his purpose like a cannonball
    Or the mean traitor breathing northern

    air
    With nasal speech and puritanic hair
    Whose cant the loss of principle survives
    As the mudturtle e
    Who caught chin buried in some foul

    offence
    Puts on a look of injured innocence
    And consecrates his baseness to the cause
    Of constitution union and the laws

    Praise to the placeman who can hold
    aloof
    His still unpurchased manhood office
    proof
    Who on his round of duty walks erect
    And leaves it only rich in selfrespect
    s lofty port
    In the Eighth Henry

    court
    But if exceptions here and there are found
    Wlio tread thus safely on enchanted ground
    The normal type the fitting symbol still
    Of those who fatten at the public mill
    s door
    Or Circe

    Give me the heroes who at tuck of
    drum

    Salute thy staff immortal Quattlebum

    Or they who doubly armed with vote aijd
    gun

    Following thy lead illustrious Atchison

    Their drunken franchise shift from scene
    to scene

    As tilebeard Jourdan did his guillotine

    Rather than him who born beneath our
    skies

    To Slaverys hand its supplest tool sup
    plies

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    And coolly makes a merit of disgrace
    Points to the footmarks of indignant scorn
    Shows the deep scars of satire

    horn
    And passes to his credit side the sum
    s martyr
    dom

    Bane of the North its canker and its
    moth
    These modern Esaus bartering rights for

    broth
    Taxing our justice with their double claim
    As fools for pity and as knaves for blame
    Who urged by party sect or trade within
    The fell embrace of Slaverys sphere of

    sin
    Part at the outset with their moral sense
    The watchful angel set for Truths defence
    Confound all contrasts good and ill  re
    verse
    The poles of life its blessing and its curse
    And lose thenceforth from their perverted

    sight
    The eternal difference twixt the wrong

    and right
    To them the Law is but the iron span
    That girds the ankles of imbruted man
    To them the Gospel has no higher aim
    Than simple sanction of the masters claim
    Dragged in the slime of Slaverys loath
    some trail
    Like Chaliers Bible at his asss tail

    Such are the men who with instinctive

    dread
    Whenever Freedom lifts her drooping head
    Make prophettripods of their officestools
    And scare the nurseries and the village

    schools
    With dire presage of ruin grim and great
    A broken Union and a foundered State
    Such are the patriots selfbound to the

    stake
    Of office martyrs for their comitry
    Who fill themselves the hungry jaws of

    Fate
    And by their loss of manhood save the

    State
    In the wide gulf themselves like Curtius

    throw
    And test the virtues of cohesive dough
    As tropic monkeys linking heads and tails
    Bridge oer some torrent of Ecuador

    vales



    Such are the men who in your churches

    rave
    To swearingpoint at mention of the slave
    When some poor parson haply unawares
    Stammers of freedom in his timid prayers
    Who if some footsore negro through the

    town
    Steals northward volunteer to hunt him

    down
    Or if some neighbor flying from disease
    Courts the mild balsam of the Southern

    breeze
    With hue and cry pursue him on his track
    s

    back
    Such are the men who leave the pedler

    cart
    s

    art
    Or in white neckcloth soothe with pious

    aim
    The graceful sorrows of some languid

    dame
    Who from the wreck of her bereavement

    saves
    The double charm of widowhood and

    slaves
    Pliant and apt they lose no chance to show
    To what base depths apostasy can go
    Outdo the natives in their readiness
    To roast a negro or to mob a press
    Poise a tarred schoolmate on the lyncher

    rail
    Or make a bonfire of their birthplace mail

    So some poor wretch whose lips no

    longer bear
    s prayer
    By fear impelled or lust of gold enticed
    Turns to tlie Crescent from the Cross of

    With brush and pitcher following grave

    and mute
    In meek attendance on the holy brute

    Men of the North  beneath your very
    eyes
    By hearth and home your real danger lies
    Still day by day some hold of freedom falls
    Through homebred traitors fed within its

    walls
    Men whom yourselves with vote and purse

    sustain
    At posts of honor influence and gain
    The right of Slavery to your sous to teach
    And  Southside

    preach
    Transfix the Law to ancient freedom dear
    On the sharp point of her subverted spear
    And imitate upon her cushion plump
    The mad Missourian lynching from his

    stump
    s floor
    Yield up to Slavery all it asks and more
    And ere your dull eyes open to the cheat
    Sell your old homestead underneath your

    feet
    While such as these your loftiest outlooks

    hold
    While truth and conscience with your wares

    are sold
    While gravebrowed merchants band them
    selves to aid
    An annual manhunt for their Southern

    trade
    What moral power within your grasp re
    mains
    To stay the mischief on Nebraska
    High as the tides of generous impulse flow
    As far rolls back the selfish undertow
    And all your brave resolves though aimed

    as true
    As the horsepistol Balmawhapple drew
    To Slaverys bastions lend as slight a shock
    As the poor trooper

    s cause

    demands
    The earnest eflorts of your hearts and hands
    Urged by all motives that can prompt the

    To prayer and toil and manhood

    Though to the souls deep tocsin Nature

    The midnight sworddance of the northern

    And to the ear that bends above the sod

    Nor chide the nuiu wliose honest doubt ex

    To the means only not the righteous ends

    Nor fail to weigh the scruples and the fears

    Of milder natures and serener years

    In the long strife with evil which began

    With the first lapse of newcreated man

    Wisely and well has Providence assigned

    To each his part  some forward some be

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    The faith of Wesley to our Western shore
    And held no convert genuine till he broke
    Alike his servants and the Devils yoke
    And priests like him who Newport
    ket trod
    And oer its slaveships shook the bolts of

    God
    So shall your power with a wise prudence

    used
    Strong but forbearing firm but not abused
    In kindly keeping with the good of all
    The nobler maxims of the past recall
    Her natural homeborn right to Freedom

    give
    And leave her foe his robberright  to live
    Live as the snake does in his noisome fen
    Live as the wolf does in his bonestrewn

    den
    Live clotlied with cursing like a robe of

    flame
    The focal point of millionfingered shame
    Live till the Southron who with all his

    faults
    Has manly instincts in his pride revolts
    Dashes from off him midst the glad world

    cheers
    The hideous nightmare of his dream of

    years
    And lifts selfprompted with his own right

    hand
    The vile encumbrance from his glorious

    land

    So wheresoeer our destiny sends forth
    Its widening circles to the South or North
    Where

    stars
    Its mimic splendors and its cloudlike bars
    There shall Free Labors hardy children

    stand
    The equal sovereigns of a slaveless land
    And when at last the hunted bison tires
    And dies oertaken by the squatters fires
    And westward wave on wave the living

    flood
    Breaks on the snowline of majestic Hood
    And lonely Shasta listening hears the tread
    Of Europe

    led
    And gazing downward through his hoar
    locks sees
    The tawny Asian climb his giant knees
    The Eastern sea shall hush his waves to

    hear
    Pacifics surfbeat answer Freedom



    un
    Between the sunrise and the sunset gun



    My task is done The Showman and his

    show
    Themselves but shadows into shadows go
    And if no song of idlesse I have sung
    Nor tints of beauty on the canvas flung
    If the harsh numbers grate on tender ears
    And the rough picture overwrought apjiears
    With deeper coloring with a sterner blast
    Before my soul a voice and vision passed
    Such as might Miltons jarring trump re
    quire
    Or glooms of Dante fringed with lurid fire
    Oh not of choice for themes of public wrong
    I leave the green and pleasant paths of song
    The mild sweet words which soften and

    adorn
    For sharp rebuke and bitter laugh of scorn
    More dear to me some song of private worth
    Some homely idyl of my native North
    Some summer pastoral of her inland vales
    Or grim and weird her winter fireside

    tales
    Haunted by ghosts of nnreturning sails
    Lost barks at parting hung from stem to

    helm
    With prayers of love like dreams on Virgils

    elm
    Nor private grief nor malice holds my pen
    I owe bixt kindness to my fellowmen
    And Soutli or North wherever hearts of

    prayer
    Their woes and weakness to our Father bear
    Wherever fruits of Christian love are found
    In holy lives to me is holy ground
    But the time passes It were vain to crave
    A late indulgence What I had I gave
    Forget the poet but his warning heed
    And shame his poor word with your nobler

    deed

    It is hardly to be credited yet is true that
    in the anxiety of the Northern merchant to
    conciliate his Southern customer a publisher
    was found ready thus to mutilate Scheffers

    picture He intended his edition for use in the
    Southern States undoubtedly but copies fell
    into the hands of those who believed literally
    in a gospel which was to preach liberty to the
    captive

    O Ary Scheffer  when beneath thine eye
    Touched with the light that cometh from

    above

    Grew the sweet picture of the dear Lords
    love
    No dream hadst thou that Christian hands

    would tear
    Tlierefroui the token of His equal care

    And make thy symbol of His truth a lie
    The poor dumb slave whose shackles fall
    away
    In His compassionate gaze grubbed

    smoothly out
    To mar no more the exercise devout
    Of sleek oppression kneeling down to pray
    Where the great oriel stains the Sabbath

    day
    Let whoso can before such prayingbooks
    Kneel on his velvet cushion  I for one
    Would sooner bow a Parsee to the sun
    Or tend a prayerwheel in Thibetar brooks
    Or beat a drum on Yedos templefloor
    No falser idol man has bowed before
    In Indian groves or islands of the sea
    Than that which through the quaint
    carved Gothic door
    Looks forth  a Church without human
    ity
    Patron of pride and prejudice and

    wrong
    The rich mans charm and fetich of the
    strong
    The Eternal Fulness meted clipped and

    shorn
    The seamless robe of equal mercy torn
    The dear Christ hidden from His kindred

    flesh
    And in His poor ones crucified afresh
    Better the simple Lama scattering wide
    Where sweeps the storm Alechans
    steppes along
    His paper horses for the lost to ride
    And wearying Buddha with his prayers to

    make
    The figures living for the travellers sake
    Than he who hopes with cheap praise to

    beguile
    The ear of God dishonoring man the while
    Who dreams the pearl gates hinges rusty
    grown



    Are moved by flatterys oil of tongue

    alone
    That in the scale Eternal Justice bears
    The generous deed weighs less than selfish

    prayers
    And words intoned with graceful unction

    move
    The Eternal Goodness more than lives of

    truth and love
    Alas the Church  The reverend head of
    Jay
    Enhaloed with its saintly silvered hair
    Adorns no more the places of her prayer
    And brave young Tyng too early called
    away
    Troubles the Hamau of her courts no

    more
    Like the just Hebrew at the Assjt

    ians door
    And her sweet ritual beautiful but dead
    As the dry husk from which the grain is

    shed
    And holy hymns from which the life de
    vout
    Of saints and martyrs has wellnigh gone

    out
    Like candles dying in exhausted air
    For Sabbath use in measured grists are

    ground
    And ever while the spiritual mill goes

    round
    Between the upper and the nether stones
    Unseen unheard the wretched bondman
    groans
    And urges his vain plea prayersmothered
    anthemdrowned

    O heart of mine keep patience  Looking
    forth

    As from the Mount of Vision I behold
    Pure just and free the Church of Christ
    on earth

    The martyrs dream the golden age fore
    told
    And found at last the mystic Graal I see

    Brimmed with His blessing pass from
    lip to lip

    In sacred pledge of human fellowship

    And over all the songs of angels hear

    Songs of the love that casteth out all fear

    Songs of the Gospel of Humanity

    Lo  in the midst with the same look He
    wore

    Healing and blessing ou Gemiesarets

    THE SUMMONS

    After publishing this poem Whittier wrote
    to Lucy Larcom   I do not quite like the tone
    of The Summons now that it is published It
    was however an expression of a state of mind
    which thee would regard as pardonable if thee
    knew all the circvimstances It is too complain
    ing and I hope I shall not be left to do such a
    thing again

    My ear is full of summer sounds
    Of summer sights my languid eye

    Beyond the dusty village bounds

    I loiter in my daily rounds

    And in the noontime shadows lie

    I hear the wild bee wind his horn

    The bird swings on the ripened wheat
    The long green lances of the corn
    Are tilting in the winds of morn
    The locust shrills his song of heat

    Another sound my spirit hears

    A deeper sound that drowns them all
    A voice of pleading choked with tears
    The call of human hopes and fears
    The Macedonian cry to Paul

    The stormbell rings the trumpet blows

    I know the word and countersign
    Wherever Freedoms vanguard goes
    Where stand or fall lier friends or foes

    I know the place that should be mine

    Shamed be the hands that idly fold

    And lips that woo the reeds accord
    When laggard Time the hour has tolled
    For true with false and new with old
    To fight the battles of the Lord

    O brothers  blest by partial Fate

    With power to match the will and deed
    To him your summons comes too late
    Who sinks beneath his armors weight
    And has no answer but Godspeed



    TO WILLIAM H SEWARD

    On the 12th of January 1861 Mr Seward
    delivered in the Senate chamber a speech on
    The State of the Union in which he urged the
    paramount duty of preserving the Union and
    went as far as it was possible to go without
    surrender of principle in concessions to the
    Southern party

    Statesman I thank thee  and if yet dis
    sent
    Mingles reluctant with my large content
    I cannot censure what was nobly meant
    But while constrained to hold even Union

    less
    Than Liberty and Truth and Righteousness
    I thank thee in the sweet and holy name
    Of peace for wise calm words that put to

    shame
    Passion and party Courage may be shown
    Not in defiance of the wrong alone
    He may be bravest who unweaponed bears
    The olive branch and strong in justice

    spares
    The rash wrongdoer giving widest scope
    To Christian charity and generous hope
    If without damage to the sacred cause
    Of Freedom and the safeguard of its

    laws
    If without yielding that for which one
    We prize the Union thou canst save it

    now
    From a baptism of blood upon thy brow
    A wreath whose flowers no earthly soil

    have known
    Woven of the beatitudes shall rest
    And the peacemaker be forever blest

    333



    Why should we
    Vex at the land
    So on his Usk banks in the bloodred dawn
    Of Englands civil strife did careless

    Vaughan
    Bemock his times O friends of many

    years
    Though faith and trust are stronger than

    our fears
    And the signs promise peace with liberty
    Not thus we trifle with our country
    s gain
    Is certain as God

    pain
    Is bitter and tears are salt  our voices take
    A sober tone  our very household songs
    s griefs and

    wrongs
    And innocent mirth is chastened for the

    sake
    Of the brave hearts that nevermore shall

    beat
    The eyes that smile no more the unreturn

    ins feet



    THY WILL BE DONE

    We see not know not  all our way
    Is night  with Thee alone is day
    From out the torrent
    Above the storm our prayers we lift
    Thy will be done

    The flesh may fail the heart may faint
    But who are we to make complaint
    Or dare to plead in times like these
    The weakness of our love of ease
    Thy will be done

    We take with solemn thankfulness
    Our burden up nor ask it less
    And count it joy that even we
    May suffer serve or wait for Thee
    Whose will be done

    Though dim as yet in tint and line
    We trace Thy pictures wise design
    And thank Thee tliat our age supplies
    Its dark relief of sacrifice
    Thy will be done

    And if in our unworthiness
    Thy sacrificial wine we press
    If from Thy ordeal



    Our feet are seamed with crimson scars
    Thy wdll be done

    If for the age to come this hour
    Of trial hath vicarious power
    And blest by Thee our present pain
    Be Libertys eternal gain
    Thy will be done

    Strike Thou the Master we Thy keys
    The anthem of the destinies
    The minor of Thy loftier strain
    Our hearts shall breathe the old refrain
    Thy vill be done



    A WORD FOR THE HOUR

    The firmament breaks up In black eclipse
    Light after light goes out One evil star
    Luridly glaring through the smoke of war
    As in the dream of the Apocalypse
    Drags others down Let us not weakly

    weep
    Nor rashly threaten Give us grace to keep
    Our faith and patience  wherefore should

    we leap
    On one hand into fratricidal fight
    Or on the other yield eternal right
    Frame lies of law and good and ill con
    found
    What fear we  Safe on freedom
    ground
    Our feet are planted  let us there remain
    In unrevengeful calm no means untried
    Which trutli can sanction no just claim

    denied
    The sad spectators of a suicide
    They break the links of Union  shall we

    light
    The fires of hell to weld anew the chain
    On that ied anvil where each blow is pain
    Draw we not even now a freer breath
    As from our shoulders falls a load of death
    s victim bore
    When keen with life to a dead horror bound
    Why take we up the accursed thing again
    Pity forgive but urge them back no more
    Who drunk with passion flaunt disunion

    rag
    With its vile reptileblazon Let us press
    The golden cluster on our brave old flag
    In closer union and if numbering less
    Brighter shall shine the stars which still

    LUTHERS HYMN

    We wait beneath the furnaceblast

    The pangs of transformation
    Not painlessly doth God recast
    And mould anew the nation
    Hot burns the fire
    Where wrongs expire
    Nor spares the hand
    That from the land
    Uproots the ancient evil

    The handbreadth cloud the sages feared

    Its bloody rain is dropping
    The poison plant the fathers spared
    All else is overtopping

    East West South North
    It curses the earth
    All justice dies
    And fraud and lies
    Live only in its shadow

    What gives the wheatfield blades of steel

    What points the rebel cannon
    What sets the roaring rabble
    On the old starspangled pennon
    What breaks the oath
    Of tlie men o the South
    What whets the knife
    For the Union
    Hark to the answer  Slavery

    Then waste no blows on lesser foes

    In strife unworthy freemen
    God lifts today the veil and shows
    The features of the demon
    O North and South
    Its victims both
    Can ye not cry
    Let slavery die
    And union find in freedom

    What though the castout spirit tear

    The nation in his going
    We who have shared the guilt must share
    The pang of his oerthrowing I
    Whate
    Whateer the cross
    Shall they complain
    Of present pain
    Who trust in God



    For who that leans on His right arm

    Was ever yet forsaken
    What righteous cause can suffer harm
    If He its part has taken
    Though wild and loud
    And dark the cloud
    Behind its folds
    His hand upholds
    The cahn sky of tomorrow

    Above the maddening cry for blood

    Above the wild wardrumming
    Let Freedoms voice be heard with good
    The evil overcoming
    Give prayer and purse
    To stay the Curse
    Whose wrong we share
    Whose shame we bear
    Whose end shall gladden Heaven

    In vain the bells of war shall ring

    Of triumphs and revenges
    While still is spared the evil thing
    That severs and estranges
    But blest the ear
    That yet shall hear
    The jubilant bell
    That rings the knell
    Of Slavery forever

    Then let the selfish lip be dumb

    And hushed the breath of sighing
    Before the joy of peace must come
    The pains of purifying
    God give us grace
    Each in his place
    To bear his lot
    And murmuring not
    Endure and wait and labor



    TO JOHN C FRLMONT

    On the nist of August 1861 General Fre
    mont then in charge of the Western Depart
    ment issued a proclamation which contained a
    clause famous as the first announcement of
    emancipation The i5roperty it declared
    real and personal of all persons in the State
    of Missouri who shall take up arms against the
    United States or who shall be directly proven
    to have taken active part with their enemies in
    the field is declared to be confiscated to the
    public use  and their slaves if any they have

    Thy error Frdmont simply was to act
    A brave mans part without the statesmans

    And taking coimsel but of common sense
    To strike at cause as well as consequence
    Oh never yet since Roland wound his horn
    At Roncesvalles has a blast been blown
    Farheard wideechoed startling as thine

    own
    Heard from the van of freedom
    lorn
    It had been safer doubtless for the time
    To flatter treason and avoid offence
    To that Dark Power whose underlying

    crime
    Heaves upward its perpetual turbulence
    But if thine be the fate of all who break
    The ground for truths seed or forerun

    their years
    Till lost in distance or with stout hearts

    make
    A lane for freedom through the level spears
    Still take thou courage  God has spoken

    through thee
    Irrevocable the mighty words Be free
    The land shakes with them and the slave

    dull ear
    Turns from the riceswamp stealthily to

    hear
    Who would recall them now must first ar
    rest
    The winds that blow down from the free

    Northwest
    Ruffling the Gulf  or like a scroll roll back
    The Mississippi to its upper springs
    Such words fulfil their prophecy and lack
    But the full time to harden into things



    THE WATCHERS

    Beside a stricken field I stood
    On the torn turf on grass and wood
    Hung heavily the dew of blood

    Still in their fresh mounds lay the slain
    But all the air was quick with pain
    And gusty sighs and tearful rain



    Two angels each with drooping head
    And folded wings and noiseless tread
    Watched by that vallej of the dead

    The one with forehead saintly bland
    And lips of blessing not connnand
    Leaned weeping on her olive wand

    The others brows were scarred and knit
    His restless eyes were watchfires lit
    His hands for battlegauntlets fit



    He



    I knew the voice of



    low long
    Peace
    Is there no respite  no release
    When shall the hopeless quarrel cease

    O Lord how long  One human soul
    Is more than any jjarchment scroll
    Or any flag thy winds unroll

    s young and

    brave
    How weigh the gift that Lyon gave
    Or count the cost of Winthrop

    O brother  if thine eye can see
    Tell how and when the end shall be
    Wliat hope remains for thee and me

    Then Freedom sternly said   I shun
    No strife nor pang beneath the sun
    When human rights are staked and won

    I knelt with Ziskas hunted flock
    I watched in Toussaint
    I walked with Sidney to the block

    The moor of MPvrston felt my tread
    Through Jersey snows the march I led
    My voice Magentas charges sped

    But now through weary day and night
    I watch a vague and aimless fight
    For leave to strike one blow aright

    On either side my foe they own

    One guards through love his ghastly throne

    And one through fear to reverence grown

    Why wait we longer mocked betrayed

    By open foes or those afraid

    To speed thy coming through my aid

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Why watch to see who win or fall

    I shake the dust against them all

    I leave them to their senseless brawl

    Nay Peace implored   yet longer wait
    The doom is near the stake is great
    God knoweth if it be too late

    Still wait and watch  the way prepare
    Where I with folded wings of prayer
    May follow weaponless and bare

    Too late   the stern sad voice replied
    Too late   its mournful echo sighed
    In low lament the answer died

    A rustling as of wings in flight

    An upward gleam of lessening white

    So passed the vision sound and siglit

    But round me like a silver bell
    Rung down the listening sky to tell
    Of holy help a sweet voice fell

    it sang
    Must fall the winepress must be trod
    But all is possible with God



    TO ENGLISHMEN

    Written when in the stress of our terrible
    war the English riiling class with few excep
    tions were either coldly indifferent or hostile to
    the party of freedom Their attitude was illus
    trated by caricatures of America amonjj which
    was one of a slaveholder and cowhide witli
    the motto
    nigger

    You flung your taunt across the wave

    We bore it as became us
    Well knowing that the fettered slave
    Left friendly lips no option save

    To pity or to blame us

    You scoffed our plea
    will

    Not lack of power you told us
    We showed our freestate records  still
    You mocked confounding good and ill

    Slavehaters and slaveholders

    We struck at Slavery  to the verge
    Of power and means we checked it



    Lo   presto change  its claims you

    urge
    Send greetings to it o
    And comfort aiid protect it

    But yesterday you scarce could shake

    In slaveabhorring rigor
    sake
    Today you clasp the hands that ache

    With

    O Englishmen   in hope and creed
    In blood and tongue our brothers

    We too are heirs of Runnymede

    And Shakespeares fame and Cromwells
    deed
    Are not alone our mother

    Thicker than water in one rill

    Through centuries of story
    Our Saxon blood has flowed and still
    We share with you its good and ill

    The shadow and the glory

    Joint heirs and kinfolk leagues of wave

    Nor length of years can part us
    Your right is ours to shrine and grave
    The common freehold of the brave
    The gift of saints and martyrs

    Our very sins and follies teach

    Our kindred frail and human
    We carp at faults with bitter sjjeech
    The while for one unshared by each
    We have a score in common

    We bowed the heart if not the knee
    To Englands Queen God bless her

    We praised you when your slaves went
    free

    We seek to unchain ours Will ye
    Join hands with the oppressor

    And is it Christian England cheers

    The bruiser not the bruised
    And must she run despite the tears
    And prayers of eighteen hundred years
    Amuck in Slavery

    Oh black disgrace  Oh shame and loss
    Too deep for tongue to phrase on

    Tear from your flag its holy cross

    And in your van of battle toss
    The pirates skullbone blazon

    MITHRIDATES AT CHIOS

    It is recorded that the Chians when subju
    S
    livered up to their own slaves to be carried
    away captive to Colchis Athenseus considers
    this a just punishment for their wickedness in
    first introducing tlie slavetrade into Greece
    From this ancient villainy of the Chians the
    proverb arose  The Chian hath bought him
    self a master

    Knowst thoxi O slavecursed land

    How when the Cliian
    Was full to overflow there came
    Gods justice in the sword of flame

    That red with slaughter to its hilt
    Blazed in the Cappadocian victor

    The heavens are still and far
    But not unheard of awful Jove
    The sighing of the island slave
    Was answered when the Egean wave
    The keels of Mithridates clove
    And the vines shrivelled in the breath of



    Robbers of Chios  hark
    s decree
    Pluck your last cluster fi
    Drain your last cup of Chian wine
    Slaves of your slaves your doom shall
    be
    In Colchian mines by Phasis rolling dark

    Then rose the long lament
    From the hoar seagods dusky caves
    The priestess rent her hair and cried
    Woe  woe  The gods are sleepless
    eyed
    And chained and scourged the slaves of
    slaves
    The lords of Chios into exile went

    The gods at last pay well
    So Hellas sang her taunting song
    The fisher in his net is cauglit
    The Chian hath his master bought
    And isle from isle with laughter long
    Took up and sped the mocking parable

    Once more the slow dumb years
    Bring their avenging cycle round

    And more than Hellas taught of old
    Our wser lesson shall be told



    Of slaves uprising freedomcrowned
    To break not wield the scourge wet with
    their blood and tears



    AT PORT ROYAL

    In November 18G1 a Union force under
    Commodore Dupont and General Sherman cap
    tured Port Royal and from this point as a
    basis of operations the neighboring islands be
    tween Charleston and Savannah were taken
    possession of The early occupation of this
    district where the negro population was gTeatly
    in excess of the white gave an opportunity
    which was at once seized upon of practically
    emancipating the slaves and of beginning that
    work of civilization which was accepted as the
    grave responsibility of those who had labored
    for freedom

    The tentlights glimmer on the land

    The shiplights on the sea
    The nightwind smooths with drifting sand

    Our track on lone Tybee

    At last our grating keels outslide
    Our good boats forward swing

    And while we ride the landlocked tide
    Our negroes row and sing

    For dear the bondman holds his gifts

    Of music and of song
    The gold that kindly Nature sifts

    Among his sands of wrong

    The power to make his toiling days
    And poor homecomforts please

    The quaint relief of mirth that plays
    With sorrow

    s fire

    Has filled the west with light
    Where field and garner barn and byre

    Are blazing through the night

    The land is wild with fear and hate

    The rout runs mad and fast
    From hand to hand from gate to gate

    The flaming brand is passed

    The lurid glow falls strong across
    Dark faces broad with smiles

    Not theirs the terror hate and loss
    That fiie yon blazing piles

    With oarstrokes timing to their song
    They weave in simple lays

    The pathos of remembered wrong

    So sing our dusky gondoliers

    And with a secret pain
    And smiles that seem akin to tears

    We hear the wild refrain

    We dare not share the negro

    Nor yet his hope deny
    We only know that God is just

    And every wrong shall die

    Rude seems the song  each swarthy face

    Flamelighted ruder still
    We start to think that hapless race

    Must shape our good or ill

    That laws of changeless justice bind

    Oppressor with oppressed
    And close as sin and sidieriug joined

    We march to Fate abreast

    Sing on poor hearts  your chant shall be

    Our sign of blight or bloom
    The Valasong of Liberty

    Or deathrune of oiu doom



    ASTRA AT THE CAPITOL

    ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DIS
    TRICT OF COLUMBIA 1 862

    The reference in the fourth stanza is to Dr
    Reuben Crandall of Washington who in 1834
    was arrested and confined in the old city prison
    until his health was destroyed His crime was
    s
    pamphlet Justice and Expediency

    When first I saw our banner wave
    Above the nation
    I heard beneatli its marble wall

    The claukinji fetters of the slave



    THE BATTLE AUTUMN OF 1862



    339



    In the foul marketplace I stood
    And saw the Christian mother sold
    And childhood with its locks of gold

    Blueeyed and fair with Saxon blood

    I shut my eyes I held my breath

    And smothering down the wrath and

    shame
    That set my Northern blood aflame

    Stood silent  where to speak was death

    Beside me gloomed the prisoncell
    Where wasted one in slow decline
    For uttering simple words of mine

    And loving freedom all too well

    The flag that floated from the dome
    Flapped menace in the morning air
    I stood a perilled stranger where

    The human broker made his home

    For crime was virtue  Gown and Sword
    And Law their threefold sanction gave
    And to the quarry of the slave

    Went hawking with our symbolbird

    On the oppressors side was power

    And yet I knew that every wrong

    However old however strong
    But waited God

    I knew that truth would crush the lie
    Somehow some time the end would be
    Yet scarcel dared I hope to see

    The triumph with my mortal eye

    But now I see it  In the sun

    A free flag floats from yonder dome
    And at the nations hearth and home

    The justice long delayed is done

    Not as we hoped in calm of prayer
    The message of deliverance comes
    But heralded by roll of drums

    On waves of battletroubled air

    Midst sounds that madden and appall
    The song that Bethlehem

    knew
    The harp of David melting through

    The demonagonies of Saul

    Not as we hoped  but what are we
    Above our broken dreams and plans



    s
    The cornerstones of liberty

    I cavil not with Him  the voice
    That freedom
    Is sweet to me as silver bells

    Rejoicing  yea I will rejoice

    Dear friends still toiling in the sun
    Ye dearer ones who gone before
    Are watching from the eternal shore

    The slow work by your hands begun

    Rejoice with me  The chastening rod
    Blossoms with love  the furnace heat
    Grows cool beneath His blessed feet

    Whose form is as the Son of God

    Rejoice  Our Marahs bitter springs
    Are sweetened  on our ground of grief
    Rise day by day m strong relief

    The prophecies of better things

    Rejoice in hope  The day and night
    Are one with God and one with tliem
    Who see by faith the cloudy hem

    Of Judgment fringed with Mercy



    THE BATTLE AUTUMN OF 1862

    The flags of war like stormbirds fly

    The charging trumpets blow
    Yet rolls no thunder in the sky

    No earthquake strives below

    And calm and patient Nature keeps

    Her ancient promise well
    Though oer her bloom and greenness
    sweeps

    The battle

    And still she walks in golden hours
    Through harvesthappy farms

    And still she wears her fruits and flowers
    Like jewels on her arms

    What mean the gladness of the plain

    This joy of eve and morn
    The mirth that shakes the beard of grain

    And yellow locks of corn

    Ah  eyes may well be full of tears
    And hearts with hate are hot

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    But evenpaced come round the years
    And Nature cliauges not

    She meets with smiles our bitter grief
    With songs our groans of pain

    She mocks with tint of flower and leaf
    The warfields crimson stain

    Still in the cannon
    Her sweet thanksgivingpsalin

    Too near to God for doubt or fear
    She shares the eternal calm

    She knows the seed lies safe below
    The fires that blast and burn

    For all the tears of blood we sow
    She waits the rich return

    She sees with clearer eye than ours
    The good of suffering born

    The hearts that blossom like her flowers
    And ripen like her corn

    Oh give to us in times like these

    The vision of her eyes
    And make her fields and fruited trees

    Our golden prophecies

    Oh give to us her finer ear

    Above this stormy din
    We too would hear the bells of cheer

    Ring peace and freedom in

    Written at the request of the teacher Miss
    Charlotte Forten now Mrs Grimk

    Oh none in all the world before

    Were ever glad as we
    We re free on Carolinas shore

    We

    Thou Friend and Helper of the poor

    Who suffered for our sake
    To open every prison door

    And every yoke to break

    Bend low Thy pitying face and mild
    And help us sing and pray

    The hand that blessed the little child
    Upon our foreheads lay



    s horn

    No more the whip we fear
    This holy day that saw Thee born

    Was never half so dear

    The very oaks are greener clad

    The waters brighter smile
    Oh never shone a day so glad

    On sweet St Helen

    We praise Thee in our songs today

    To Thee in prayer we call
    Make swift the feet and straight the way

    Of freedom unto all

    Come once again O blessed Lord

    Come walking on the sea
    And let the mainlands hear the word

    That sets the island free



    THE PROCLAMATION

    President Lincolns proclamation of emanci
    pation was issued January 1 1SG3

    Saint Patrick slave to Milcho of the

    herds
    Of Ballymena wakened with these words

    Arise and flee
    Out from the land of bondage and be free

    Glad as a soul in pain who hears from

    heaven
    The angels singing of his sins forgiven

    And wondering sees
    His prison opening to their golden keys

    He rose a man who laid him down a slave
    Shook from his locks the ashes of the grave

    And outward trod
    Into the glorious liberty of God

    He cast the symbols of his shame away
    And passing where the sleeping Milcho

    lay
    Though back and limb
    Smarted with wrong he prayed
    don him

    So went he forth  but in God

    came
    To light on Uillines hills a holy flame

    And dying gave
    The land a saint that lost him as a slave

    O dark sad millions patiently and dumb
    Waiting for God your hour at last has
    come
    And freedom
    Breaks the long silence of your night of
    wrong

    Arise and flee  shake off the vile restraint
    s saint

    The oppressor spare
    Heap only on his head the coals of prayer

    Go forth like him  like him return again
    To bless the land whereon in bitter pain

    Ye toiled at first
    And heal with freedom what your slavery
    cursed

    ANNIVERSARY POEM

    Read before the Alumni of the Friends
    Yearly Meeting School at the Annual Meeting
    at Newport R I 15th Cth mo 1863

    Once more dear friends you meet beneath

    A clouded sky
    Not yet the sword has found its sheath
    And on the sweet spring airs the breath

    Of war floats by

    Yet trouble springs not from the ground

    Nor pain from chance
    The Eternal order circles round
    And wave and storm find mete and bound

    In Providence

    Full long our feet the flowery ways

    Of peace have trod
    Content with creed and garb and phrase
    A harder path in earlier days

    Led up to God

    Too cheaply truths once purchased dear

    Are made our own
    Too long the world has smiled to hear
    Our boast of full corn in the ear

    By others sown

    To see us stir the martyr fires

    Of long ago
    And wrap our satisfied desires
    In the singed mantles that our sires

    Have dropped below



    But now the cross our worthies bore

    On us is laid
    Professions quiet sleep is o
    And in the scale of truth once more

    Our faith is weighed

    The cry of innocent blood at last

    Is calling down
    An answer in the whirlwindblast
    The tlumder and the shadow cast

    From Heavens dark frown

    The land is red with judgments Who

    Stands guiltless forth
    Have we been faithful as we knew
    To God and to our brother true

    To Heaven and Earth

    How faint through din of merchandise

    And count of gain
    Have seemed to us the captive
    How far away the tears and sighs

    Of souls in pain

    This day the fearful reckoning comes

    To each and all
    We hear amidst our peaceful homes
    The summons of the conscript drums

    The bugles call

    Our path is plain  the warnet draws

    Round us in vain
    While faithful to the Higher Cause
    We keep our fealty to the laws

    Through patient pain

    The levelled gun the battlebrand

    We may not take
    But calmly loyal we can stand
    And suffer with our suffering land

    For conscience

    Why ask for ease where all is pain

    Shall we alone
    Be left to add our gain to gain
    When over Armageddons plain

    The trump is blown

    To suffer well is well to serve

    Safe in our Lord
    The rigid lines of law shall curve
    To spare us  from our heads shall swerve

    Its smiting sword

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    And light is mingled with the gloom

    And joy with grief
    Divinest compensations come
    Through thorns of judgment mercies bloom

    In sweet relief

    Thanks for our privilege to bless

    By word and deed
    The widow in her keen distress
    The childless and the fatherless

    The hearts that bleed

    For fields of duty opening wide

    Where all our powei
    Are tasked the eager steps to guide
    Of millions on a path untried

    The slave is ours

    Ours by traditions dear and old

    Which make the race
    Our wards to cherish and uphold
    And cast their freedom in the mould

    Of Christian grace

    And we may tread the sickbed floors

    Where strong men pine
    And down the groaning corridors
    Pour freely from our liberal stores

    The oil and wine

    Who murmurs that in these dark days

    His lot is cast
    Gods hand within the shadow lays
    The stones whereon His gates of praise

    Shall rise at last

    Turn and o

    Nor stint nor stay
    The years have never dropped their sand
    On mortal issue vast and grand

    As ours today

    Already on the sable ground

    Of mans despair
    Is Freedom
    With all its dusky hands unbound

    Upraised in prayer

    Oh small shall seem all sacrifice

    And pain and loss
    When God shall wipe the weeping eyes
    s prize

    The crown for cross



    BARBARA FRIETCHIE

    This poem was written in strict conformity
    to the account of the incident as I had it from
    respectable and trustworthy sources It has
    since been the subject of a good deal of con
    flicting testimony and the story was probably
    incorrect in some of its details It is admitted
    by all that Barbara Frietchie was no myth but
    a worthy and highly esteemed gentlewoman
    intensely loyal and a hater of the Slavery Re
    bellion holding her Union flag sacred and
    keeping it with her Bible  that when the Con
    federates halted before her house and entered
    her dooryard she denounced them in vigorous
    language shook her cane in their faces and
    drove tliem out  and when General Burnside
    s she waved
    her flag and cheered them It is stated that
    May Quantrell a brave and loyal lady in an
    other part of the city did Avave her flag in
    sight of the Confederates It is possible that
    there has been a blending of the two incidents

    Up from the meadows rich with corn
    Clear in the cool September morn

    The clustered spires of Frederick stand
    Greenwalled by the hills of Maryland

    Round aboiit them orchards sweep
    Apple and peach tree fruited deep

    Fair as the garden of the Lord

    To the eyes of the famished rebel horde

    On that pleasant morn of the early fall
    When Lee marched over the mountain
    wall

    Over the mountains winding down
    Horse and foot into Frederick town

    Forty flags with their silver stars
    Forty flags with their crijnson bars

    Flapped in the morning wind  the sun
    Of noon looked down and saw not one

    Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then
    Bowed with her fourscore years and ten

    Bravest of all in Frederick town

    She took up the flag the men hauled down



    WHAT THE BIRDS SAID



    343



    111 her attic window the staff she set
    To show that oiie heart was loyal yet

    Up the street came the rebel tread
    Stonewall Jackson riding ahead

    Under his slonched hat left and right
    He glanced  the old flag met his sight

    Halt    the dnstbrown ranks stood

    fast
    Fire    out blazed the rifleblast

    It shivered the window pane and sash
    It rent the banner with seam and gash

    Quick as it fell from the broken staff
    Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf

    She leaned far out on the windowsill
    And shook it forth with a royal will

    Shoot if you must this old gray head
    she said

    A shade of sadness a blush of shame
    Over the face of the leader came

    The nobler nature within him stirred
    To life at that woman

    Who touches a hair of yon gray head
    Dies like a dog  March on   he said

    All day long through Frederick street
    Sounded the tread of marching feet

    All day long that free flag tost
    Over the heads of the rebel host

    Ever its torn folds rose and fell

    On the loyal winds that loved it well

    And through the hillgaps sunset light
    Shone over it with a warm goodnight

    Barbara Frietchies work is o

    And the Rebel rides on his raids no more

    Honor to her  and let a tear

    s bier

    Over Barbara Frietchie
    Flag of Freedom and Union wave



    Peace and order and beauty draw
    Round thy symbol of light and law

    And ever the stars above look down
    On thy stars below in Frederick town



    WHAT THE BIRDS SAID

    The birds against the April wind

    Flew northward singing as they flew

    They sang  The land we leave behind
    Has swords for cornblades blood for
    dew

    O wildbirds flying from the South
    What saw and heard ye gazing down

    We saw the mortars upturned mouth
    The sickened camp the blazing town

    Beneath the bivouacs starry lamps
    We saw your marchworn children die

    In shrouds of moss in cypress swamps
    We saw your dead uncoffined lie

    We heard the starving prisoner
    And saw from line and trench your
    sons

    Follow our flight with homesick eyes
    Beyond the batterys smoking guns

    And heard and saw ye only wrong

    And pain I cried  O wing  worn
    flocks
    We heard they sang  the freedman
    song
    The crash of Slaverys broken locks

    We saw from new uprising States
    The treasonnursing mischief spurned

    As crowding Freedoms ample gates
    The longestranged and lost returned

    O
    And hands hornhard with unpaid toil

    With hope in every rustling fold
    We saw your stardropt flag uncoil

    And struggling up through sounds ac
    cursed
    A grateful murmur clomb the air
    A whisjier scarcely heard at first

    It filled the listening heavens with
    prayer

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    And sweet and far as from a star
    Replied a voice which shall not cease

    Till drowning all the noise of war
    It sings the blessed song of peace

    So to me in a donbtful day

    Of chill and slowly greening spring
    Low stoojing from the cloudy gray

    The wildbirds sang or seemed to sing

    They vanished in the misty air

    The song went with them in their flight
    But lo  they left the sunset fair

    And in the evening there was light



    THE MANTLE OF ST JOHN
    DE MATHA

    A LEGEND OF THE RED WHITE AND
    BLUE A D 1 1541864

    A STRONG and mighty Angel

    Calm terrible and bright
    The cross in blended red and blue

    Upon his mantle white

    Two captives by him kneeling

    Each on his broken chain
    Sang praise to God who raiseth

    The dead to life again

    Dropping his crosswrought mantle
    Wear this the Angel said

    Take thou O Freedoms priest its sign
    The white the blue and red

    Then rose up John de Matha

    In the strength the Lord Christ gave
    And begged through all the land of France

    The ransom of the slave

    The gates of tower and castle

    Before him open flew
    The drawbridge at his coming fell

    The doorbolt backward drew

    For all men owned his errand

    And paid his righteous tax
    And the hearts of lord and peasant

    Were iu his hands as wax

    At last outbound from Tunis

    His bark her anchor weighed
    Freighted with sevenscore Christian souls

    Whose ransom he had paid



    But torn by Paynim hatred

    Her sails in tatters hung
    And on the wild waves rudderless

    A shattered hulk she swung

    God save us

    For naught can man avail
    Oh woe betide the ship that lacks

    Her rudder and her sail

    Behind us are the Moormen

    At sea we sink or strand
    There

    There s death upon the land

    Then up spake John de Matha

    God
    Take thou the mantle which I wear

    And make of it a sail

    They raised the crosswrought mantle

    The blue the white tlie red
    And straight before the wind oflshore

    The ship of Freedom sped

    God help us   cried the seamen

    For vain is mortal skill
    The good ship on a stormy sea

    Is drifting at its will

    Then up spake John de Matha

    My mariners never fear
    The Lord whose breath has filled her
    sail

    May well our vessel steer

    So on through storm and darkness

    They drove for weary hours
    And lo  the third gray morning shone

    On Ostias friendly towers

    And on the walls the watchers

    The ship of mercy knew
    They knew far off its holy cross

    The red the white and blue

    And the bells in all the steeples

    Rang out in glad accord
    To welcome home to Christian soil

    The ransomed of the Lord

    So runs the ancient legend

    By bard and painter told
    And lo  the cycle rounds again

    The new is as the old



    LAUS DEO



    345



    With rudder foully broken

    And sails by tiaitors toru
    Our couuti

    Is waiting for the morn

    Before her nameless terror

    Behind the pirate foe
    The clouds are black above her

    The sea is white below

    The hope of all who suffer
    The dread of all who wrong

    She drifts in darkness and in storm
    How long O Lord  how long

    But courage O my mariners

    Ye shall not suffer wreck
    s prayers

    Are rising from your deck

    Is not your sail the banner
    Which God hath blest anew

    The mantle that De Matha wore
    The red the white the blue

    Its hues are all of heaven

    The red of sunset
    The whiteness of the moonlit cloud

    The blue of mornings sky

    Wait cheerily then O mariners

    For daylight and for land
    The breath of God is in your sail

    Your rudder is His hand

    Sail on sail on deepfreighted
    With blessings and with hopes

    The saints of old with shadowy hands
    Are pulling at your ropes

    Behind ye holy martyrs

    Uplift the palm and crown

    Before ye unborn ages send
    Their benedictions down

    Take heart from John de Matha

    God
    Sweep on through storm and darkness

    The thunder and the hail I

    Sail on 1 The morning cometh

    The port ye yet shall win
    And all the bells of God shall ring

    The good ship bravely in I



    LAUS DEO

    On hearing the bells ring on the passage of
    the constitutional amendment abolishing slav
    ery The resolution was adopted by Congress
    January 31 1805 The ratification by the re
    quisite number of States was announced Decem
    ber 18 1805 The suggestion came to the poet
    Meetinghouse in Ames
    bury where he was present at the regular Fifth
    day meeting All sat in silence but on his
    return to his home he recited a portion of the
    poem not yet committed to paper to his house
    mates in the garden room   It wrote itself or
    rather sang itself while the bells rang
    wrote to Lucy Larcom

    It is done

    Clang of bell and roar of gun
    Send the tidings up and down

    How the belfries rock and reel

    How the great guns peal on peal
    Fling the joy from town to town

    Ring O bells
    Every stroke exulting tells

    Of the burial hour of crime

    Loud and long that all may hear
    Ring for every listening ear

    Of Eternity and Time

    Let us kneel
    Gods own voice is in that peal

    And this spot is holy ground

    Lord forgive us  What are we
    That our eyes this glory see

    That our ears have heard the sound

    For the Lord

    On the whirlwind is abroad
    In the earthquake He has spoken

    He has smitten with His thunder

    The iron walls asunder
    And the gates of brass are broken

    Loud and long
    Lift the old exulting song
    Sing with ISIiriam by the sea
    He has cast the mighty down
    Horse and rider sink and drown
    He hath triumphed gloriously

    Did we dare
    In our agony of prayer
    Ask for more than He has done

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    When was ever His right hand
    Over any time or land
    Stretched as now beneath the sun

    How they pale
    Ancient myth and song and tale

    In this wonder of our days
    When the cruel rod of war
    Blossoms white with righteous law

    And the wrath of man is praise

    Blotted out

    All within and all about
    Shall a fresher life begin

    Freer breathe the universe

    As it rolls its heavy curse
    On the dead and buried sin

    It is done
    In the circuit of the sun

    Shall the sound thereof go forth
    It shall bid the sad rejoice
    It shall give the dumb a voice

    It shall belt with joy the earth

    Ring and swing
    Bells of joy  On mornings wing

    Send the song of praise abroad
    With a sound of broken chains
    Tell the nations that He reigns

    Who alone is Lord and God



    HYMN

    FOR THE CELEBRATION OF EMANCIPA
    TION AT NEWBURYPORT

    Not unto us who did but seek

    The word that burned within to speak

    Not unto us this day belong

    The triumph and exultant song

    Lpon us fell in early youth
    The burden of unwelcome truth
    And left us weak and frail and few
    The censors painful work to do

    Thenceforth our life a fight became
    The air we breathed was hot with blame
    For not with gauged and softened tone
    We made the bondmans cause our own

    We bore as Freedoms hope forlorn
    The private hate the public scorn



    Yet held through all the paths we trod
    Our faith in man and trust in God

    We prayed and hoped  but still with awe
    The coming of the sword we saw
    We heard the nearing steps of doom
    We saw the shade of things to come

    In grief which they alone can feel
    Who from a mothers wrong appeal
    With blended lines of fear and hope
    We cast our countrys horoscope

    For still within her house of life
    We marked the lurid sign of strife
    And poisoning and inibittering all
    We saw the star of Wormwood fall

    Deep as our love for her became
    Our hate of all that wiought her shame
    And if thereby with tongue and pen
    We erred  we were but mortal men

    We hoped for peace  our eyes survey
    The bloodred dawn of Freedoms day
    We prayed for love to loose the chain
    Tis shorn by battles axe in twain

    Nor skill nor strength nor zeal of ours
    Has mined and heaved the hostile towers
    Not by our hands is turned the key
    That sets the sighing captives free

    A redder sea than Egypts wave
    Is piled and parted for the slave
    A darker cloud moves on in light
    A fiercer fire is guide by night

    The praise O Lord  is Thine alone
    In Thy own way Thy work is done
    Our poor gifts at Thy feet we cast
    To whom be glory first and last

    The negros broken chains
    And beat them at the blacksmiths forge

    Alike henceforth our liills of snow
    And vales where cotton flowers

    All streams that flow all winds that blow
    Are Freedoms motivepowers

    Henceforth to Labors chivalry

    Be knightly lionors paid
    For nobler than the swords shall be

    The sickles accolade

    Build up an altar to the Lord

    O grateful hearts of ours
    And shape it of the greenest sward

    That ever drank the showers

    Lay all the bloom of gardens there
    And there the orchard fruits

    Bring golden grain from sun and air
    From earth her goodly roots

    There let our banners droop and flow

    The stars uprise and fall
    Our roll of martyrs sad and slow

    Let sighing breezes call

    Their names let hands of horn and tan
    And roughshod feet applaud

    Who died to make the slave a man
    And link with toil reward

    There let the common heart keep time

    To such an anthem sung
    As never swelled on poet

    Or thrilled on singers tongue

    Song of our burden and relief

    Of peace and long annoy
    The passion of our mighty grief

    And our exceeding joy

    A song of praise to Him who filled

    The harvests sown in tears
    And gave each field a double yield

    To feed our battleyears

    A song of faith that trusts the end

    To match the good begun

    The thirtyninth congress was that which
    met in 1865 after the close of the war when it
    was charged with the great question of recon
    struction  the vipperinost subject in men
    minds was the standing of those who had le
    cently been in arms against the Union and
    their relations to the freedmen

    O PEOPLECHOSEN  are ye not
    Likewise the chosen of the Lord
    To do His will and speak His word

    From the loud thunderstorm of war
    Not man alone hath called ye forth
    But He the God of all the earth

    The torch of vengeance in your hands
    He quenches  unto Him belongs
    The solemn recompense of wrongs

    Enough of blood the land has seen
    And not by cell or gallowsstair
    Shall ye the way of God prepare

    Say to the pardonseekers  Keep

    Your manhood bend no suppliant knees
    Nor palter with unworthy pleas

    Above your voices soimds the wail
    Of starving men  we shut in vain
    Our eyes to Pillows ghastly stain

    What words can drown that bitter cry
    What tears wash out the stain of death
    What oaths confirm your broken faith

    From you alone the guaranty

    Of union freedom peace we claim
    We urge no conqueror

    Alas  no victors pride is ours
    We bend above our triumphs won
    Like David o

    Be men not beggars Cancel all

    By one brave generous action  trust
    Your better instincts and be just

    Make all men peers before the law

    Give black and white an equal vote

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    Keep all your forfeit lives and lauds
    But give the common laws rediess
    To labor

    Revive the old heroic will

    Be in the right as brave and strong
    As ye have proved yourselves in wrong

    Defeat shall then be victory

    Your loss the wealth of full amends
    And hate be love and foes be friends

    Then buried be the dreadful past

    Its common slain be mourned and let
    All memories soften to regret

    Then shall the Unions motherheart
    Her lost and wandering ones recall
    Forgiving and restoring all

    And Freedom break her marble trance
    Above the Capitolian dome
    Stretch hands and bid ye welcome
    home



    THE HIVE AT GETTYSBURG

    In the old Hebrew myth the lion

    So terrible alive
    Bleached by the deserts sun and wind be
    came

    The wandering wild bees
    And he who lone and nakedhanded tore

    Those jaws of death apart
    In after time drew forth their honeyed store

    To strengthen his strong heart

    Dead seemed the legend  but it only slept

    To wake beneath our sky
    Just on the spot whence ravening Treason
    crept
    Back to its lair to die
    s moun
    tain bounds

    THE EMANCIPATION GROUP

    Moses Kimball a citizen of Boston pre
    s
    Memorial statue erected in Lincoln Square
    Washington The group which stands in Park
    Square represents the figure of a slave from
    whose limbs the broken fetters have fallen
    kneeling in gratitude at the feet of Lincoln
    The group was designed by Thomas Ball and
    was unveiled December 9 1879 These verses
    were written for the occasion

    Amidst thy sacred effigies

    Of old renown give place
    O city Freedomloved  to his

    Whose hand unchained a race

    Take the worn frame that rested not

    Save in a martyr
    The carelined face that none forgot

    Bent to the kneeling slave

    Let man be free  The mighty word
    He spake was not his own

    An impulse from the Highest stirred
    These chiselled lips alone



    The cloudy sign the fiery guide

    Along his pathway ran
    And Nature through his voice denied

    The ownership of man

    We rest in peace where these sad eyes

    Saw peril strife and pain
    His was the nations sacrifice

    And ours the priceless gain

    O symbol of God

    As it is done above
    Bear witness to the cost and worth

    Of justice and of love

    Stand in thy place and testify

    To coming ages long
    That truth is stronger than a lie

    And righteousness than wrong

    THE JUBILEE SINGERS

    A number of students of Fisk University
    under the direction of one of the officers gave
    a series of concerts in the Northern States for
    the purpose of establishing the college on a
    firmer financial foundation Their hymns and
    songs mostly in a minor key touched the
    hearts of the people and were received as pe
    culiarly expressive of a race delivered from
    bondage

    Voice of a people suffering long
    The pathos of their mournful song
    The sorrow of their night of wrong

    Their cry like that which Israel gave
    A prayer for one to guide and save
    s wave

    The stern accord her timbrel lent
    To Miriam
    Oer Egypt

    The tramp that startled camp and town
    And shook the walls of slavery down
    The spectral march of old John Brown

    The storm that swept through battledays

    The triumph after long delays

    The bondmen giving God the praise

    Voice of a ransomed race sing on
    Till Freedoms every right is won
    And slavery

    ANTISLAVERY POEMS



    GARRISON

    The earliest poem in this division was my
    youthful tribute to the great reformer when
    himself a young man he was first sounding his
    trumpet in Essex County I close with the
    verses inscribed to him at the end of his earthly
    career May 24 1879 My poetical service in
    the cause of freedom is thus almost synchro
    nous with his life of devotion to the same cause

    The storm and peril overpast

    The hounding hatred shamed and still
    Go sold of freedom  take at last

    The place which thou alone canst fill

    Confirm the lesson taught of old
    Life saved for self is lost while they

    Who lose it in His service hold
    The lease of Gods eternal day

    Not for thj

    Thy words of thunder shook the world

    No selfish griefs or hatred gave

    The strength wherewith thy bolts were
    hurled

    From lips that Sinais trumpet blew
    We heard a tender under song

    Thy very wrath from pity grew

    From love of man thy hate of wrong



    Now past and present are as one

    The life below is life above
    Thy mortal years have but begun

    Thy immortality of love

    With somewhat of thy lofty faith
    We lay thy outworn garment by

    Give death but what belongs to death
    And life the life that cannot die

    Not for a soul like thine the calm
    Of selfish ease and joys of sense

    But duty more than crown or palm
    Its own exceeding recompense

    Go up and on  thy day well done
    Its morning promise well fulfilled

    Arise to triumphs yet unwon

    To holier tasks that God has willed

    Go leave behind thee all that mars
    The work below of man for man

    With the white legions of the stars
    Do service such as angels can

    Wherever wrong shall right deny
    Or suffering spirits urge their plea

    Be thine a voice to smite the lie
    A hand to set the captive free

    THE QUAKER OF THE OLDEN
    TIME

    The Quaker of tlie olden time

    How calm and firm and true
    Unspotted by its wrong and crime

    He walked the dark earth through
    The lust of power the love of gain

    The thousand lures of sin
    Around him had no power to stain

    The purity within

    With that deep insight which detects

    All great things in the small
    And knows how each man

    The spiritual life of all
    He walked by faith and not by sight

    By love and not by law
    The presence of the wrong or right

    He rather felt than saw

    He felt that wrong with wrong partakes

    That nothing stands alone
    That whoso gives the motive makes

    His brothers sin his own
    And pausing not for doubtful choice

    Of evils great or small
    He listened to that inward voice

    Which called away from all

    O Spirit of that early day

    So pure and strong and true
    Be with us in the narrow way

    Our faithful fathers knew
    Give strength the evil to forsake

    The cross of Truth to bear
    And love and reverent fear to make

    Our daily lives a prayer

    Breaker of Slaverys chain and rod



    The foe of all which pains the sight
    Or wounds the generous ear of God

    Beautifid yet thy temples rise

    Though there profaning gifts are thrown
    And fires unkindled of the skies

    Are glaring round thy altarstone

    Still sacred though thy name be breathed
    By those whose hearts thy truth de
    ride
    And garlands plucked from thee are
    wreathed
    Around the haughty brows of Pride

    Oh ideal of my boyhood

    The faith in which my father stood
    Even when the sons of Lust and Crime

    Had stained thy peaceful courts with
    blood

    Still to those courts my footsteps turn
    For through the mists which darken there

    I see the flame of Freedom burn

    The generous feeling pure and warm
    Which owns the right of all divine

    The pitying heart the helping arm
    The prompt selfsacrifice are thine

    Beneath thy broad impartial eye

    How fade the lines of caste and birth

    How equal in their suffering lie
    The groaning multitudes of earth

    Still to a stricken brother true

    Whatever clime hath nurtured him

    THE GALLOWS

    Written on reading pamphlets published by
    clergymen against the abolition of the gallows
    Originally entitled Lines



    The suns of eighteen centuries have shone
    Since the Redeemer walked with man and
    made

    And mountain moss a pillow for His
    head
    And He who wandered with the peasant

    hymn
    From lips which press the temple

    floor
    Or kiss the gilded sign of the dread cross
    He bore



    Yet as of old when meekly  doing good

    He fed a blind and selfish midtitude

    And even the poor companions of His lot

    With their dim earthly vision knew Him
    not
    How ill are His high teachings under
    stood

    Where He liath spoken Liberty the priest
    At His own altar binds the chain anew

    Where He hath spoken Peace His name
    hath been

    blessed

    The unsheathed sword and laid the spear
    in rest

    Wet the warbanner with their sacred wine

    And crossed its blazon with the holy sign

    Yea in His name who bade the erring live

    And daily taught His lesson to forgive
    Twisted the cord and edged the murder

    THE HUMAN SACRIFICE

    Some leading sectarian papers had lately
    published the letter of a clergyman giving
    an account of his attendance upon a criminal
    who had committed murder during a fit of
    intoxication at the time of his execution in
    western New York The writer describes the
    agony of the wretched being his abortive at
    tempts at prayer his appeal for life his fear
    of a violent death  and after declaring his
    belief that the poor victim died without hope
    of salvation concludes with a warm eulogy
    upon the gallows being more than ever con
    vinced of its utility by the awful dread and
    horror which it inspired



    Far from his close and noisome cell

    By grassy lane and sunny stream
    Blown clover field and strawberry dell
    And green and nieadow freshness fell

    The footsteps of his dream
    Again from careless feet the dew

    Of summer
    Again with merry heart he threw

    His light line in the rippling brook
    Back crowded all his schoolday joys

    He urged the ball and quoit again
    And heard the shout of laughing boys

    Come ringing down the walnut glen



    Again he felt the western breeze

    With scent of flowers and crisping hay
    And down again through windstirred trees

    He saw the quivering sunlight play
    An angel in homes vinehung door
    He saw his sister smile once more
    Once more the truant
    Upon his mothers knees was laid
    And sweetly lulled to slumber there
    With evening



    He woke At once on heart and brain
    The present Terror rushed again
    s chain
    He woke to hear the churchtower tell
    Time
    And shuddering feel that clanging din
    His lifes last hour had ushered in
    To see within his prisonyard
    Tlu
    The gallows shadow rising dim
    Between the sunrise heaven and him
    A horror in Gods blessed air

    A blackness in his morning light
    Like some foul devilaltar there

    Built up by demon hands at night

    And maddened by that evil sight
    Dark horrible confused and strange
    A chaos of wild weltering change
    All power of check and guidance gone
    Dizzy and blind his mind swept on
    In vain he strove to breathe a prayer

    In vain he turned the Holy Book
    He only heard the gallowsstair

    Creak as the wind its timbers shook
    No dream for him of sin forgiven

    While still that baleful spectre stood

    With its hoarse murmur
    Blood
    Between him and the pitying Heaven

    Ill

    Low on his dungeon floor he knelt

    And smote his breast and on his chain
    Whose iron clasp he always felt

    His hot tears fell like rain
    And near him with the cold calm look
    And tone of one whose formal part
    Unwarmed unsoftened of the heart
    Is measured out by rule and book
    With placid lip and tranquil blood
    The hangman
    Blessing with solemn text and word
    The gallowsdrop and strangling cord

    He saw the victim

    The sweat of anguish starting there
    The record of a nameless woe
    In the dim eyes imploring stare
    Seen hideous through the long damp
    hair
    Fingers of ghastly skin and bone
    Working and writhing on the stone
    And heard by mortal terror wrung
    From heaving breast and stiffened tongue
    The choking sob and low hoarse prayer
    As o
    A vision of the eternal flame
    Its smoking cloud of agonies
    Its demon worm that never dies
    The everlasting rise and fall
    Of firewaves round the infernal wall
    While high above that dark red flood
    Black giantlike the gallows stood
    Two busy fiends attending there
    One with cold mocking rite and prayer
    The other with impatient grasp
    s strangling
    clasp



    The nnfelt rite at length was done

    The jjrayer unheard at length was said
    An hour had passed  the noonday sun

    Smote on the features of the dead
    And he who stood the doomed beside
    Calm ganger of the swelling tide
    Of mortal agony and fear
    Heeding with curious eye and ear
    Whate
    Of mans extremest wretchedness
    And who in that dark anguish saw

    An earnest of the victim
    s law

    The kindlings of Eternal hate
    The first drops of that fiery rain
    Which beats the dark red realm of pain
    Did he uplift his earnest cries

    Against the crime of Law which gave

    His brother to that fearful grave
    Whereon Hope

    And Faiths white blossoms never wave
    To the soft breath of Memory
    Which sent a spirit marred and stained
    By fiends of sin possessed profaned
    In madness and in blindness stark



    Into the silent unknown dark

    No from the wild and shrinking dread

    With which he saw the victim led

    Beneath the dark veil which divides
    Ever the living from the dead

    And Natures solemn secret hides
    The man of prayer can only draw
    New reasons for his bloody law
    New faith in staying Murder
    By murder at that Laws command
    New reverence for the gallowsrope
    As human nature
    Last relic of the good old time
    When Power found license for its crime
    And held a writhing world in check
    By that fell cord about its neck
    Stifled Seditions rising shout
    Choked the young breath of Freedom out
    And timely checked the words which

    sprung
    From Heresy
    While in its noose of terror bound
    The Church its cherished union found
    Conforming on the Moslem plan
    The motleycolored mind of man
    Not by the Koran and the Sword
    But by the Bible and the Cord



    O Thou  at whose rebuke the grave
    Back to warm life its sleeper gave
    Beneath whose sad and tearful glance
    The cold and changed countenance
    Broke the still horror of its trance
    And waking saw with joy above
    A brotliers face of tenderest love
    Thou unto whom the blind and lame
    The sorrowing and the sinsick came
    And from Thy very garment
    Drew life and healing unto them
    The burden of Tliy holy faith
    Was love and life not hate and death
    Mans demon ministers of pain

    The fiends of his revenge were sent

    From thy pure Gospel
    To their dark home again
    Thy name is Love  What then is he

    Who in that name the gallows rears
    An awful altar built to Thee

    With sacrifice of blood and tears
    Oh once again Thy healing lay

    On the blind eyes which knew Thee
    not
    And let the light of Thy pure day

    Melt in upon his darkened thought

    So underneath its clouds of sin

    The heart of man retaineth yet
    Gleams of its holy origin

    And halfquenched stars that never set
    Dim colors of its faded bow

    And early beauty linger there
    And oer its wasted desert blow

    Faint breathings of its morning air
    Oh never yet upon the scroll
    Of the sinstained but priceless soul

    Hath Heaven inscribed
    Cast not the clouded gem away
    Quench not the dim but living ray

    My brother man Beware
    With that deep voice which from the skies
    Forbade the Patriarch

    Gods angel cries Forbear

    DEDICATION

    Prefixed to the volume of which the group
    of six poems following this prelude constituted
    the first portion

    I WOULD the gift I offer here

    Might graces from thy favor take
    And seen through Friendship
    phere
    On softened lines and coloring wear
    The unaccustomed light of beauty for thy
    sake

    Few leaves of Fancys spring remain

    But what I have I give to thee
    The oersunned bloom of summers

    plain
    And paler flowers the latter rain
    Calls from the westering slope of life
    autumnal lea

    Above the fallen groves of green

    Where youths enchanted forest stood



    Dry root and mossed trunk between
    A sober aftergrowth is seen
    As springs the pine where falls the gay
    leafed maple wood

    Yet birds will sing and breezes play

    Their leafharps in the sombre tree
    And through the bleak and wintry day
    It keeps its steady green alway
    So even my afterthoughts may have a
    charm for thee

    Art

    And beauty is its own excuse
    But for the dull and flowerless weed
    Some healing virtue still must plead
    And the rough ore must find its honors in
    its use

    So haply these my simple lays

    Of homely toil may serve to show
    The orchard bloom and tasselled maize
    s ways
    The unsung beauty hid life
    things below

    Haply from them the toiler bent

    Above his forge or plough may gain
    A manlier spirit of content
    And feel that life is wisest spent
    Where the strong working hand makes
    strong the woiking brain

    The doom which to the guilty pair
    Without the walls of Eden came
    Transforming sinless ease to care
    And rugged toil no more shall bear
    The burden of old crime or mark of pri
    mal shame

    A blessing now a curse no more

    Since He whose name we breathe
    with awe
    The coarse mechanic vesture wore
    A poor man toiling with the poor
    In labor as in prayer fulfilling the same
    law

    Call out again your long array

    In the olden merry manner
    Once more on gay St Crisjjin

    Fling out your blazoned banner

    Rap rap  upon the wellworn stone

    How falls the polished hammer
    Kap rap  the measured sound has grown

    A quick and merry clamor
    Now shape the sole  now deftly curl

    The glossy vamp around it
    And bless the while the brighteyed girl

    Whose gentle fingers bound it

    For you along the Spanish main

    A hundred keels are ploughing
    For you the Indian on the plain

    His lassocoil is throwing
    For you deep glens with hemlock dark

    The woodmans fire is lighting
    For you upon the oak

    The woodmans axe is smiting

    For you from Carolina

    The rosingum is stealing
    For you the darkeyed Florentine

    Her silken skein is reeling
    For you the dizzy goatherd roams

    His rugged Alpine ledges
    For you roimd all her shepherd homes

    Bloom Englands thorny hedges

    The foremost still by day or night

    On moated mound or heather
    Where

    Brought toiling men together
    Where the free burghers from the wall

    Defied the mailclad master
    Than yours at Freedoms trumpetcall

    No craftsmen rallied faster

    Let foplings sneer let fools deride

    Ye heed no idle scorner
    Free hands and hearts are still your pride

    And duty done your honor
    Ye dare to trust for honest fame

    The jury Time empanels
    And leave to truth each noble name

    Which glorifies your annals

    Thy songs Hans Sachs are living yet
    In strong and hearty German

    And Bloomfields lay and Giffords wit
    And patriot fame of Sherman

    Still from his book a mystic seer



    The soul of Behmen teaches
    And England

    Shuts down upon the prairie
    On Beauty

    Or twinkle down the summer dance

    Beneath the Crystal Mountains

    The red brick to the mason

    The shoe in yours shall wealth command

    Like fairy Cinderella
    As they who shunned the household maid

    Beheld the crown upon her
    So all shall see your toil repaid

    With hearth and home and honor

    Then let the toast be freely quaffed

    In water cool and brimming

    THE FISHERMEN

    Hurrah  the seaward breezes

    Sweep down the bay amain
    Heave up my lads the anchor

    Run up the sail again
    Leave to the lubber landsmen

    The railcar and the steed
    The stars of heaven shall guide us

    The breath of heaven shall speed

    From the hilltop looks the steeple
    And the lighthouse from the sand



    THE LUMBERMEN



    359



    And the scattered pines are waving
    Their farewell from the land

    One glance my lads behind us
    For the homes we leave one sigh

    Ere we take the change and chances
    Of the ocean and the sky

    Now brothers for the icebergs

    Of frozen Labrador
    Floating spectral in the moonshine

    Along the low black shore
    Where like snow the gannet

    On Bradors rocks are shed
    And the noisy murr are flying

    Like black scuds overhead

    Where in mist the rock is hiding

    And the sharp reef lurks below
    And the white squall smites in summer

    And the autumn tempests blow
    Where through gray and rolling vapor

    From evening unto morn
    A thousand boats are hailing

    Horn answering unto horn

    Hurrah  for the Red Island

    With the white cross on its crown
    Hurrah  for Meccatina

    And its mountains bare and brown
    Where the Caribou

    Oer the dwarfwood freely toss
    And the footstep of the Mickmack

    Has no sound upon the moss

    There we

    Old Oceans treasures in
    Where

    Turns up a steeldark fin
    The sea s our field of harvest

    Its scaly tribes our grain
    We

    As at home they reap the plain

    Our wet hands spread the carpet

    And light the hearth of home
    From our fish as in the old time

    The silver coin shall come
    As the demon fled the chamber

    Where the fish of Tobit lay
    So ours from all our dwellings

    Shall frighten Want away

    Though the mist upon our jackets
    In the bitter air congeals



    And our lines wind stiff and slowly
    From off the frozen reels

    Though the fog be dark around us
    And the storm blow high and loud

    We will whistle down the wild wind
    And laugh beneath the cloud

    In the darkness as in daylight

    On the water as on land
    Gods eye is looking on us

    And beneath us is His hand
    Death will find us soon or later

    On the deck or in the cot
    And we cannot meet him better

    Than in working out our lot

    Hurrah  hurrah  the westwind

    Comes freshening down the bay
    The rising sails are filling

    Give way my lads give way
    Leave the coward landsman clinging

    To the dull earth like a weed
    The stai

    The breath of heaven shall speed



    THE LUMBERMEN

    Wildly round our woodland quarters

    Sadvoiced Autumn grieves
    Thickly down these swelling waters

    Float his fallen leaves
    Through the tall and naked timber

    Columnlike and old
    Gleam the sunsets of November

    From their skies of gold

    Oer us to the southland heading

    Screams the gray wildgoose
    On the nightfrost sounds the treading

    Of the brindled moose
    Noiseless creeping while we

    Frost his taskwork plies
    Soon his icy bridges heaping

    Shall our logpiles rise

    When with sounds of smothered thunder

    On some night of rain
    Lake and river break asunder

    Winters weakened chain
    Down the wild March flood shall bear them

    To the sawmill
    Or where Steam the slave shall tear them

    With his teeth of steel

    SONGS OF LABOR AND REFORM



    Beit starlight be it moonlight

    In these vales below
    When the earliest beams of sunlight

    Streak the mountains snow
    Crisps the hoarfrost keen and early

    To our hurxyiug feet
    And the forest echoes clearly

    All our blows repeat

    Where the crystal Ambijejis

    Stretches broad and clear
    And Millnoket

    Hide the browsing deer
    Where through lakes and wide morasses

    Or through rocky walls
    Swift and strong Penobscot passes

    White with foamy falls

    Where through clouds are glimpses given

    Of Katahdins sides
    Rock and forest piled to heaven

    Torn and ploughed by slides
    Far below the Indian trapping

    In the sunshine warm
    Far above the snowcloud wrapping

    Half the peak in storm

    Where are mossy carpets better

    Thau the Persian weaves
    And than Eastern perfumes sweeter

    Seem the fading leaves
    And a music wild and solemn

    From the pinetree
    Rolls its vast and sealike volume

    On the wind of night

    Make we here our camp of winter

    And through sleet and snow
    Pitchy knot and beechen splinter

    On our hearth shall glow
    Here with mirth to lighten duty

    We shall lack alone
    Womans smile and girlhood

    Childhoods lisping tone

    But their hearth is brighter burning

    For our toil today
    And the welcome of returning

    Shall our loss repay
    When like seamen from the waters

    From the woods we come
    Greeting sisters wives and daughters

    Angels of our home



    Not for us the measiued ringing

    From the village spire
    Not for us the Sabbath singing

    Of the sweetvoiced choir
    Ours the old majestic temple

    Where God
    Down the dome so grand and ample

    Propped by lofty pines

    Through each branchenwoven skylight

    Speaks He in the breeze
    As of old beneath the twilight

    Of lost Edens trees
    For His ear the inward feeling

    Needs no outward tongue
    He can see the spirit kneeling

    While the axe is swung

    Heeding truth alone and turning

    From the false and dim
    Lamp of toil or altar burning

    Are alike to Him
    Strike then comrades  Trade is waiting

    On our rugged toil
    Far ships waiting for the freighting

    Of our woodland spoil

    Ships whose traffic links these highlands

    Bleak and cold of ours
    With the citronplanted islands

    Of a clime of llowers
    To our frosts the tribute bringing

    Of eternal heats
    In our lap of winter flinging

    Tropic fruits and sweets

    Cheerly on the axe of labor

    Let the sunbeams dance
    Better than the flash of sabre

    Or the gleam of lance
    Strike  With every blow is given

    Freer sua and sky
    And the longhid earth to heaven

    Looks with wondering eye

    Loud behind us grow the murmurs

    Of the age to come
    Clang of smiths and tread of farmers

    Bearing harvest home
    Here her virgin lap with treasures

    Shall the green earth fill
    Waving wheat and golden maizeears

    Crown each beechen hill

    Take the smoothshorn plain
    Give to us the cedarn valleys

    Rocks and hills of Maine
    In our Northland wild and woody

    Let us still have part
    Rvigged nurse and mother sturdy

    Hold us to thy heart

    Oh our free hearts beat the warmer

    For thy breath of snow
    And our tread is all the firmer

    For thy rocks below
    Freedom hand in hand with labor

    Walketh strong and brave
    On the forehead of his neighbor

    No man writeth Slave




    Pinetrees show its fires
    While from these dim forest gardens

    Rise their blackened spires
    Up my comrades  up and doing

    Manhood
    Still renewing bravely hewing

    Through the world our way



    THE SHIPBUILDERS

    The sky is ruddy in the east

    The earth is gray below
    And spectral in the rivermist

    The ships white timbers show
    Then let the soimds of measured stroke

    And grating saw begin
    The broadaxe to the gnarled oak

    The mallet to the pin

    Hark  roars the bellows blast on blast

    The sooty smithy jars
    And firesparks rising far and fast

    Are fading with the stars
    All day for us the smith shall stand

    Beside that flashing forge
    All day for us his heavy hand

    The groaning anvil scourge

    From faroff hills the panting team

    For us is toiling near
    For us the raftsmen down the stream

    Their island barges steer
    Rings out for us the axeman

    In forests old and still



    For us the centurycircled oak
    Falls crashing down his hill

    Up  up  in nobler toil than ours

    No craftsmen bear a part
    We make of Natures giant powers

    The slaves of human Art
    Lay rib to rib and beam to beam

    And drive the treenails free
    Nor faithless joint nor yawning seam

    Shall tempt the searching sea

    Where

    The seas rough field shall plough
    Where

    With saltspray caught below
    s beck

    Her helm obey his hand
    And seamen tread her reeling deck

    As if they trod the land

    Her oaken ribs the vulturebeak

    Of Northern ice may peel
    The sunken rock and coral peak

    May grate along her keel
    And know we well the painted shell

    We give to wind and wave
    Must float the sailor

    Or sink the sailors grave

    Ho  strike away the bars and blocks

    And set the good ship free
    Why lingers on these dusty rocks

    The young bride of the sea
    Look  how she moves adown the grooves

    In graceful beauty now
    How lowly on the breast she loves

    Sinks down her virgin prow

    God bless her  wheresoe

    Her snowy wing shall fan
    Aside the frozen Hebrides

    Or sultry Hindostan
    Whereer in mart or on the main

    With peaceful flag unfurled

    No groaning cargo of despair

    Her roomy hold within

    Through heat and cold and shower and

    Still onward cheerly driving
    There s life alone in duty done

    And rest alone in striving
    But see  the day is closing cool

    The woods are dim before us
    The white fog of the wayside pool

    Is creeping slowly oer us

    The night is falling comrades mine

    Our footsore beasts are weary
    And through yon elms the tavern sign

    Looks out upon us cheery
    The landlord beckons from his door

    His beechen fire is glowing
    These ample barns with feed in store

    Are filled to overflowing

    From many a valley frowned across

    By brows of rugged mountains
    From hillsides where through spongy
    moss

    Gush out the river fountains
    From quiet farmfields green and low

    And bright with blooming clover
    From vales of corn the wandering crow

    No richer hovers over

    Day after day our way has been

    Oer many a hill and hollow
    By lake and stream by wood and glen

    Our stately drove we follow
    Through diistclouds rising thick and dun

    As smoke of battle oer us
    Their white horns glisten in the sun

    Like plumes and crests before us

    We see them slowly climb the hill

    As slow behind it sinking



    Or thronging close from roadside rill

    Or sunny lakelet drinking
    Now crowding in the narrow road

    In thick and struggling masses
    They glare upon the teamsters load

    Or rattling coach that passes

    Anon with toss of horn and tail

    And paw of hoof and bellow
    They leap some farmers broken pale

    Oer meadowclose or fallow
    Forth comes the startled goodman  forth

    Wife children housedog sally
    Till once more on their dusty path

    The baffled truants rally

    We drive no starvelings scraggy grown

    Looselegged and ribbed and bony
    Like those who grind their noses down

    On pastures bare and stony
    Lank oxen rough as Indian dogs

    And cows too lean for shadows
    Disputing feebly with the frogs

    The crop of sawgrass meadows

    In our good drove so sleek and fair

    No bones of leanness rattle
    No tottering hidebound ghosts are there

    Or Pharaohs evil cattle
    Each stately beeve bespeaks the hand

    That fed him uniepining
    The fatness of a goodly land

    In each dun hide is shining

    We
    nooks

    The freshest feed is growing
    By sweetest springs and clearest brooks

    Through honeysuckle flowing
    Wherever hillsides sloping south

    Are bright with early grasses
    s drouth

    The mountain streamlet passes

    But now the day is closing cool

    The woods are dim before us
    The wliite fog of the wayside pool

    Is creeping slowly o

    We
    Ere yet the pines of Kearsarge

    Have seen the sun of morning

    When suowflakes oer the frozen earth

    Instead of birds are flitting
    When childien throng the glowing hearth

    And quiet wives are knitting
    While in the firelight strong and clear

    Young eyes of pleasure glisten
    To tales of all we see and hear

    The ears of home shall listen

    By many a Northern lake and hill

    From many a mountain pasture
    Shall Fancy play the Drover still

    And speed the long night faster
    Then let us on through shower and sma

    THE HUSKERS

    It was late in mild October and the long

    autumnal rain
    Had left the summer harvest  fields all

    green with grass again
    The first sharp frosts had fallen leaving all

    the woodlands gay
    s rainbow or the

    meadowflowers of May

    Through a thin dry mist that morning the

    smi rose broad and red
    At first a rayless disk of fire he brightened

    as he sped
    Yet even his noontide glory fell chastened

    and subdued
    On the cornfields and the orchards and

    softly pictured wood

    And all that quiet afternoon slow sloping

    to the night
    He wove with golden shuttle the haze with

    yellow light
    Slanting through the painted beeches he

    glorified the hill
    And beneath it pond and meadow lay

    brighter greener still



    And shouting boys in woodland haunts
    caught glimpses of that sky

    Flecked by the manytinted leaves and
    laughed they kiiew not why

    And schoolgirls gay with asterflowers
    beside the meadow brooks

    Mingled the glow of autumn with the sun
    shine of sweet looks

    From spire and barn looked westerly the
    patient weathercocks

    But even the birches on the hill stood mo
    tionless as rocks

    No sound was in the woodlands save the
    squirrel

    And the yellow leaves among the boughs
    low rustling as they fell

    The summer grains were harvested  the

    stubblefields lay dry
    Where June winds rolled in liglit and

    shade the pale green waves of

    rye
    But still on gentle hillslojjes in valleys

    fringed with wood
    Ungathered bleaching in the sun the

    heavy corn crop stood

    Bent low by autumns wind and rain

    through husks that dry and sere
    Unfolded from tlieir ripened charge shone

    out the yellow ear
    Beneath the turnip lay concealed in many

    a verdant fold
    And glistened in the slanting light the

    pumpkin

    There wrought the busy harvesters  and

    many a creaking wain
    Bore slowly to the long barnfloor its load

    of husk and grain
    Till broad and red as when he rose the sun

    sank down at last
    And like a merry guests farewell the day

    in bi

    And lo  as through the western pines on
    meadow stream and pond

    Flamed the red radiance of a sky set all
    afire beyond

    Slowly oer the eastern seablufis a milder
    glory shone

    And the sunset and the moonrise were min
    gled into one

    As thus iuto the quiet uiglit the twilight

    lapsed away
    And deeper in the brightening moon the

    tranquil shadows lay
    From many a brown old farmhouse and

    hamlet without name
    Their milking and their hometasks done

    the merry buskers came

    Swung o

    pitchforks in the mow
    Shone dimly down the lanterns on the

    pleasant scene below
    The growing pile of busks behind the

    golden ears before
    And laughing eyes and busy hands and

    er

    Half hidden in a quiet nook serene of

    look and heart
    Talking their old times over the old men

    sat apart
    While up and down the unbusked jjile

    or nestling in its shade
    At bideandseek with laugh and shout

    the happy children played

    Urged by the good host

    maiden young and fair
    Lifting to light her sweet blue eyes and

    pride of soft brown hair
    The master of the village school sleek of

    hair and smootli of tongue
    To the quaint tune of some old psalm a

    huskingballad sung

    Heap high the farmers wintry hoai

    Heap high the golden corn
    No richer gift has Autumn poured

    From out her lavish horn

    Let other lands exulting glean

    The apple from the pine
    The orange from its glossy green

    The cluster from the vine

    We better love the hardy gift

    Our rugged vales bestow
    To cheer us when the storm shall drift

    Our harvestfields with snow

    Through vales of grass and meads of flowers
    Our ploughs their furrows made



    While on the hills the sun and showers
    Of changeful April played

    We dropped the seed oer hill and plain

    Beneath the sun of May
    And frightened from our sprouting grain

    The robber crows away

    All through the long bright days of June
    Its leaves grew green and fair

    And waved in hot midsummers noon
    Its soft and yellow hair

    And now with autumns moonlit eves

    Its harvesttime has conie
    We pluck away the frosted leaves

    And bear the treasure home

    There when the snows about us drift

    And winter winds are cold
    Fair bands the broken grain shall sift

    And knead its meal of gold

    Let vapid idlers loll in silk

    Around their costly board
    Give us the bowl of samp and milk

    By homespun beauty poured

    Whereer the wade old kitchen hearth

    Sends up its smoky curls
    Who will not tliank the kindly earth

    And bless our farmer girls

    Then shame on all the proud and vain

    Whose folly laughs to scorn
    The blessing of our hardy grain

    Our wealth of golden corn

    Let earth withhold her goodly root

    Let mildew blight the rye
    Give to the worm the orchards fruit

    The wheatfield to the fly

    But let the good old crop adorn

    The bills our fathers trod
    Still let us for his golden corn

    Send up our thanks to God

    Essajecl in vain her ghostly charm
    Wealth shook within his gilded home
    With strange alarm

    Fraud from his secret chambers fled

    Before the sunlight bursting in

    Sloth drew her pillow oer her head

    To drown the din

    Spare Art implored  yon holy pile

    That grand old timeworn turret spare
    Meek Reverence kneeling in the aisle
    Cried out  Forbear

    Graybearded Use who deaf and blind
    Groped for his old accustomed stone
    Leaned on his staff and wept to find
    His seat oerthrown

    Young Romance raised his dreamy eyes

    Oerhung with paly locks of gold

    Why smite

    The fair the old

    Yet louder rang the Strong Ones stroke

    Yet nearer flashed his axes gleam
    Shuddering and sick of heart I woke
    As from a dream

    I looked  aside the dustcloud rolled

    The Waster seemed the Builder too
    Upspringing from the ruined Old
    I saw the New

    T was but the ruin of the bad

    The wasting of the wrong and ill
    Whateer of good the old time had
    Was living still

    Calm grew the brows of him I feared

    The frown which awed me passed away
    And left behind a smile which cheered
    Like breaking day

    The grain grew green on battleplains
    Oer swarded warmounds grazed the
    cow
    The slave stood forging from his chains
    The spade and plough

    Where frowned the fort pavilions gay

    And cottage windows flowerentwined
    Looked out upon the peaceful bay
    And hills behind



    Through vinewreathed cups with wine once
    red
    The lights on brimming crystal fell
    Drawn sparkling from the rivulet head
    And mossy well

    Through prison walls like Heavensent
    hope
    Fresh breezes blew and sunbeams
    strayed
    And with the idle gallowsrope

    The young child played

    Where the doomed victim in his cell
    Had counted oer the weary hours
    Glad schoolgirls answering to the bell
    Came crowned with flowers

    Grown wiser for the lesson given

    I fear no longer for I know
    That where the share is deepest driven
    The best fruits grow

    The outworn rite the old abuse

    The pious fraud transparent grown
    The good held captive in the use
    Of wrong alone

    These wait their doom from that great law
    Which makes the past time serve today
    And fresher life the world shall draw
    From their decay

    Oh backwardlooking son of time

    The new is old the old is new
    The cycle of a change sublime
    Still sweeping through

    So wisely taught the Indian seer

    Destroying Seva forming Brahm
    Who wake by turns Earths love and fear
    Are one the same

    Idly as thou in that old day

    Thou mournest did thy sire repine
    So in his time thy child grown gray
    Shall sigh for thine

    But life shall on and upward go

    Th eternal step of Progress beats

    To that great anthem calm and slow

    Which God repeats

    Still in thy streets O Paris  doth the stain
    Of blood defy the cleansing autumn rain
    Still breaks the smoke Messinas ruins

    through
    And Naples mourns that new Bartholomew
    When squalid beggary for a dole of bread
    At a crowned murderers beck of license

    fed
    The yawning trenches with her noble dead
    Still doomed Vienna through thy stately

    Flames in the breach of Moultans shattered

    On Chenabs side the vulture seeks the slain
    And Sutlej paints with blood its banks again

    What folly then
    cries

    With sneering lip and wise worldknowing
    eyes

    While fort to fort and post to post repeat

    The ceaseless challenge of the wardrum
    beat

    And round the green earth to the church
    bells chime

    The morning drumroll of the camp keeps
    time

    To dream of peace amidst a world in arms

    Of swords to ploughshares changed by

    The Rnss from banquets with the vulture

    shared
    The blood still dripping from his amber

    Quitting their mad Berserker dance to hear
    The dull meek droning of a drabcoat seer
    Leaving the sport of Presidents and Kings
    Where men for dice each titled gambler

    To meet alternate on the Seine and Thames

    And oer the present wilderness of crime
    Sees the calm future with its robes of

    Its fleeceflecked mountains and soft

    streams between
    Still keep the path which duty bids ye tread
    Though worldly wisdom shake the cautious

    head
    No truth from Heaven descends upon our

    sphere
    Without the greeting of the skeptics sneer
    Denied and mocked at till its blessings fall
    Common as dew and sunshine over all

    Then oer Earths war field till the

    strife shall cease
    Like Morvens harpers sing your song of

    peace
    As in old fable rang the Thracians lyre
    Midst howl of fiends and roar of penal fire
    Till the fierce din to pleasing murmurs fell
    And love subdued the maddened heart of

    hell
    Lend once again that holy song a tongue
    Which the glad angels of the Advent sung
    Their cradleanthem for the Saviours birth
    Glory to God and peace unto the earth
    Through the mad discord send that calming

    word
    Which wind and wave on wild Gennesareth

    heard
    Lift in Christs name his Cross against the

    Sword
    Not vain the vision which the prophets saw
    Skirting with green the fiery waste of war
    Through the hot sandgleam looming soft

    and calm
    On the skys rim the fountain  shading

    palm
    Still lives for Earth which fiends so long

    have trod
    The great hope resting on the truth of

    God
    Evil shall cease and Violence pass away
    And the tired world breathe free through

    a long Sabbath day



    THE PRISONER FOR DEBT

    Before the law authorizing imprisonment for
    debt had been abolished in Massachusetts a
    revolutionary pensioner was confined in Charles



    town jail for a debt of fourteen dollars and
    on the fourth of July was seen waving a hand
    kerchief from the bars of his cell in honor of
    the day

    Look on him  through his dungeon grate

    Feebly and cold the morning light
    Comes stealing round him dim and late

    As if it loathed tlie sight
    Reclining on his strawy bed
    His hand upholds his drooping head
    His bloodless cheek is seamed and hard
    Unshorn his gray neglected beard
    And oer his bony fingers flow
    His long dishevelled locks of snow

    No grateful fire before him glows
    And yet the winters breath is chill

    And oer his halfclad person goes
    The frequent ague thrill

    Silent save ever and anon

    A sound half murmur and half groan

    Forces apart the painful grip

    Of the old sufferers bearded lip

    Oh sad and crushing is the fate

    Of old age chained and desolate

    Just God  why lies that old man there

    A murderer shares his prison bed
    Whose eyeballs through his horrid hair

    Gleam on him fierce and red
    And the rude oath and heartless jeer
    Fall ever on his loathing ear
    And or in wakefulness or sleep
    Nerve flesh and pulses thrill and creep
    Wheneer that ruffians tossing limb
    Crimson with murder touches him

    What has the grayhaired prisoner done

    Has murder stained his hands with gore
    Not so  his crime s a fouler one

    God made the old man poor
    For this he shares a felons cell
    The fittest earthly type of hell
    For this the boon for which he poured
    His young blood on the invaders sword
    And counted light the fearful cost
    His bloodgained liberty is lost

    And so for such a place of rest

    Old prisoner dropped thy blood as rain

    On Concords field and Bunkers crest
    And Saratogas plain

    Look forth thou man of many scars

    Through thy dim dungeons iron bars

    Think ye his dim aud failing eye

    Is kindled at your pageantry

    Sorrowing of soid and chained of limb

    What is your carnival to him

    Down with the law that binds him thus

    Unworthy freemen let it find
    No refuge from the withering curse

    Of god and humankind
    Open the prisons living tomb
    And usher from its brooding gloom
    The victims of your savage code
    To the free svm and air of God
    No longer dare as crime to brand
    The chastening of the Almightys hand



    THE CHRISTIAN TOURISTS

    The reader of the biography of William
    Allen the philanthropic associate of Clarkson
    and Romilly cannot fail to admire his simple
    and beautifnl record of a tour through Europe
    in the years 1S18 and 181 in the company of
    his American friend Stephen Grellett

    No aimless wanderers by the fiend Unrest
    Goaded from shore to shore

    No schoolmen turning in their classic
    quest
    The leaves of empire oer

    Simple of faith and bearing in their hearts
    The love of man and God



    Isles of old song the Moslems ancient
    marts
    Aud Scythias steppes they trod

    Where the long shadows of the fir and pine

    In the night sun are cast
    And the deep heart of many a Norland
    mine
    Quakes at each riving blast
    Where in barbaric grandeur Moskwa
    stands
    A baptized Scythian queen
    With Europes arts and Asias jewelled
    hands
    The North and East between

    Where still through vales of Grecian fable
    stray
    The classic forms of yore
    And beauty smiles new risen from the
    spray
    And Dian weeps once more
    Where every tongue in Smyrnas mart re
    sounds
    And Stamboul from the sea
    Lifts her tall minarets over burialgrounds
    Black with the cypresstree

    From Maltas temples to the gates of Rome

    Following the track of Paul
    And where the Alps gird round the Switz
    ers home

    Their vast eternal wall
    They paused not by the ruins of old time

    They scanned no pictures rare
    Nor lingered where the snowlocked moun
    tains climb

    The cold abyss of air

    But unto prisons where men lay in chains

    To haunts where Hunger pined
    To kings and courts forgetful of the pains

    And wants of humankind
    Scattering sweet words and quiet deeds of
    good

    Along their way like flowers
    Or pleading as Christs freemen only could

    With princes and with powers

    Their single aim the purpose to fulfil

    Of Truth from day to day
    Simply obedient to its guiding will

    They held their pilgrim way
    Yet dream not hence the beautiful and old

    Were wasted on their sight



    THE MEN OF OLD



    369



    Who in the school of Christ had learned to
    hold
    All ovitward things aright

    Not less to them the breath of vineyards
    blown

    From off the Cyprian shore
    Not less for them the Alps in sunset shone

    That man they valued more
    A life of beauty lends to all it sees

    The beauty of its thought
    And fairest forms and sweetest harmonies

    Make glad its way unsought

    In sweet accordancy of praise and love

    The singing waters run
    And sunset mountains wear in light above

    The smile of duty done
    Sure stands the promise  ever to the
    meek

    A heritage is given
    Nor lose they Earth who singlehearted
    seek

    The righteousness of Heaven



    THE MEN OF OLD

    Well speed thy mission bold Iconoclast
    Yet all unworthy of its trust thou art
    If with dry eye and cold unloving
    heart
    Thou tread st the solemn Pantheon of the
    Past
    By the great Futures dazzling hope

    made blind
    To all the beauty power and truth be
    hind
    Not without reverent awe shouldst thou
    put by
    The cypress branches and the amaranth

    blooms
    Where with clasped hands of prayer
    upon their tombs
    The effigies of old confessors lie
    Gods witnesses  the voices of His will
    Heard in the slow march of the centuries

    still
    Such were the men at whose rebuking

    frown
    Dark with Gods wrath the tyrants knee

    went down
    Such from the terrors of the guilty drew
    The vassals freedom and the poor mans
    due



    St Anselm may he rest forevermore
    In Heavens sweet peace  forbade of

    old the sale
    Of men as slaves and from the sacred

    pale
    Hurled the Northumbrian buyers of the

    poor
    To ransom souls from bonds and evil fate
    St Ambrose melted down the sacred

    plate
    Image of saint the chalice and the pix
    Crosses of gold and silver candlesticks
    Man is worth more than temples

    replied
    To such as came his holy work to chide
    And brave Cesarius stripping altars bare
    And coining from the Abbeys golden

    hoard
    The captives freedom answered to the

    prayer
    Or threat of those whose fierce zeal for

    the Lord
    An earthen

    dish
    The last sad supper of the Master bore
    Most miserable sinners  do ye wish

    More than your Lord and grudge His

    dying poor
    What your own pride and not His need

    requires
    Souls than these shining gauds He

    values more
    Mercy not sacrifice His heart desires
    O faithful worthies  resting far behind
    In your dark ages since ye fell asleep
    Much has been done for truth and human
    kind
    Shadows are scattered wherein ye groped

    blind
    Man claims his birthright freer pulses

    leap
    Through peoples driven in your day like

    sheep
    Yet like your own our ages sphere of

    light
    Though widening still is walled around by

    night
    With slow reluctant eye the Church has

    read
    Skeptic at heart the lessons of its Head
    Counting too oft its living members less
    Than the walls garnish and the pulpits

    dress
    Worldmoving zeal with power to bless

    and feed

    Instead of bread holds out the stone of

    creed
    Sect builds and worships where its wealth

    and pride
    And vanity stand shrined and deified
    Careless that in the shadow of its walls
    Gods living temple into ruin falls
    We need methinks the prophethero still
    Saints true of life and martyrs strong of

    To tread the land even now as Xavier

    trod
    The streets of Goa barefoot with his

    bell
    Proclaiming freedom in the name of God
    And startling tyrants with the fear of

    Soft words smooth prophecies are

    We need the souls of fire the hearts of

    TO PIUS IX

    The writer of these lines is no enemy of
    Catholics He has on more than one occa
    sion exposed himself to tlie censures of his
    Protestant brethren by his strenuous endea
    vors to procure indemnification for the own
    ers of the convent destroyed near Boston
    He defended the cause of the Irish patriots
    long before it had become popular in this
    country  and he was one of the first to urge
    the most liberal aid to the suffering and starv
    ing population of the Catholic island The
    severity of his language finds its ample apol
    ogy in the relixetant confession of one of the
    most eminent Romish priests the eloquent
    and devoted Father Ventura

    The cannons brazen lips are cold

    No red shell blazes down the air
    And street and tower and temple old

    Are silent as despair

    The Lombard stands no more at bay
    Romes fresh young life has bled in vain

    The ravens scattered by the day
    Come back with night again

    Now while the fratricides of France
    Are treading on the neck of Rome



    Hider at Gaeta seize thy chance
    Coward and cruel come

    Creep now from Naples bloody skirt
    Thy mummers part was acted well

    While Rome with steel and fire begirt
    Before thy crusade fell

    Her deathgroans answered to thy prayer

    Thy chant the drum and buglecall
    Thy lights the burning villas glare

    Thy beads the shell and ball

    Let Austria clear thy way with hands
    Foul from Anconas cruel sack

    And Naples with his dastard bands
    Of murderers lead thee back

    Romes lips are dumb  the orphans wail
    Tlie mothers shriek thou mayst not hear

    Above the faithless Frenchmans hail
    The unsexed shavelings cheer

    Go bind on Rome her castoff weight
    The double curse of crook and crown

    Though womans scorn and manhoods hate
    From wall and roof flash down

    Nor heed those bloodstains on the wall
    Not Tibers flood can wash away

    Where in thy stately Quirinal
    Thy mangled victims lay

    Let the world murmur  let its cry
    Of honor and disgust be heard

    Truth stands alone  thy coward lie
    Is backed by lance and sword

    The cannon of St Angelo

    And chanting priest and clanging bell
    And beat of drum and bugle blow

    Shall greet thy coming well

    Let lips of iron and tongues of slaves
    Fit welcome give thee  for her part

    Rome frowning oer her newmade graves
    Skall curse thee from her heart

    No wreaths of sad Campagnas flowers
    Shall childhood in thy pathway fling

    No garlands from their ravaged bowers
    Shall Ternis maidens bring

    But hateful as that tyrant old
    The mocking witness of his crime



    OUR STATE



    371



    In thee shall loathing eyes behold
    The Nero of our time

    Stand where Romes blood was freest shed
    Mock Heaven with impious thanks and
    call

    Its curses on the patriot dead
    Its blessings on the Gaul

    Or sit upon thy throne of lies

    A poor mean idol bloodbesmeared

    Whom even its worshippers despise
    Unhonored unrevered

    Yet Scandal of the World  from thee
    One needful truth mankind shall learn

    That kings and priests to Liberty
    And God are false in turn

    Earth wearies of them  and the long
    Meek sufferance of the Heavens doth
    fail

    Woe for weak tyrants when the strong
    Wake struggle and prevail

    Not vainly Roman hearts have bled
    To feed the Crosier and the Crown

    If roused thereby the world shall tread
    The twinborn vampires down



    CALEF IN BOSTON
    1692

    In the solemn days of old

    Two men met in Boston town

    One a tradesman frank and bold
    One a preacher of renown

    Cried the last in bitter tone
    Poisoner of the wells of truth

    Satan

    With his tares the heart of youth

    Spake the simple tradesman then
    God be judge twixt thee and me

    All thou knowest of truth hath been
    Once a lie to men like thee

    Falsehoods which we spurn today
    Were the truths of long ago
    Let the dead boughs fall away
    Fresher shall the living grow



    God is good and God is light
    In this faith I rest secure
    Evil can but serve the right
    Over all shall love endure

    Of your spectral puppet play

    I have traced the cunning wires
    Come what will I needs must say
    God is true and ye are liars

    When the thought of man is free
    Error fears its lightest tones

    So the priest cried
    And the people took up stones

    In the ancient buryingground
    Side by side the twain now lie

    One with humble grassy mound
    One with marbles pale and high

    But the Lord hath blest the seed

    Which that tradesman scattered then

    And the preacher
    Chills no more the blood of men

    Let us trust to one is known

    Perfect love which casts out fear

    While the others joys atone
    For the wrong he suffered here



    OUR STATE

    Originally entitled Dedication of a School
    house It was written for the dedication services
    of a new school building in Newbury Mass

    The Southland boasts its teeming cane
    The prairied West its heavy grain
    And sunset
    On rising marts and sands of gold

    Rough bleak and hard our little State
    Is scant of soil of limits strait
    Her yellow sands are sands alone
    Her only mines are ice and stone

    From Autumn frost to April rain
    Too long her winter woods complain
    From budding flower to falling leaf
    Her summer time is all too brief

    Yet on her rocks and on her sands
    And wintry hills the schoolhouse stands

    And what her rugged soil denies
    The harvest of the mind supplies

    The riches of the Commonwealth
    Are free strong minds and hearts of health
    And more to her than gold or grain
    The cunning hand and cultured brain

    For well she keeps her ancient stock
    The stubborn strength of Pilgrim Rock
    And still maintains with milder laws
    And clearer light the Good Old Cause

    Nor heeds the skeptics puny hands
    While near her school the church  spire

    stands
    Nor fears the blinded bigot

    school



    THE PRISONERS OF NAPLES

    I HAVE been thinking of the victims boimd

    Li Naples dying for the lack of air

    And sunshine in their close damp cells of

    pain
    Where hope is not and innocence in vain
    Appeals against the torture and the chain
    Unfortunates  whose crime it was to share
    Our common love of freedom and to dare
    In its behalf Rome
    And her base pander the most hateful

    thing
    Who upon Christian or on Pagan ground
    Makes vile the old heroic name of king
    O God most merciful  Father just and

    kind
    Whom man hath bound let thy right hand

    unbind
    Or if thy purposes of good behind
    Their ills lie hidden let the sufferers find
    Strong consolations  leave them not to

    doubt
    Thy providential care nor yet without
    The hope which all thy attributes inspire
    s robe of

    fire
    Is worn nor the sad prisoner

    chain
    Since all who suffer for thy truth send

    forth
    Electrical with every throb of pain
    Unquenchable sparks thy own baptismal



    Of fire and spirit over all the earth
    Making the dead in slavery live again
    Let this great hope be with them as they

    lie
    Shut from the light the greenness and the

    sky
    From the cool waters and the pleasant

    breeze
    The smell of flowers and shade of summer

    trees
    Bound with the felon lepers whom dis
    ease
    And sins abhorred make loathsome  let

    them share
    Pellicos faith Foresti
    Years of unutterable torment stern and

    still
    As the chained Titan victor through his

    will
    Comfort them with thy future  let them

    see
    The daydawn of Italian liberty
    For that with all good things is hid with

    Thee
    And perfect in thy thought awaits its time

    to be

    I who have spoken for freedom at the
    cost

    Of some weak friendships or some paltry
    prize

    Of name or place and more than I have
    lost

    Have gained in wider reach of sympathies

    And free communion with the good and
    wise

    May God forbid that I should ever boast

    Such easy selfdenial or repine

    That the strong pulse of health no more is
    mine

    That overworn at noonday I must yield

    To other hands the gleaning of the field

    What shall I render O my God to thee
    Let me not dwell upon my lighter share
    Of pain and ill that human life must bear
    Save me from selfish pining  let my heart
    Drawn from itself in sympathy forget
    The bitter longhigs of a vain regret
    The anguish of its own peculiar smart
    Remembering others as I have today
    In their great sorrows let me live alway
    Not for myself alone but have a part
    Such as a frail and erring spirit may
    In love which is of Thee and which indeed
    Thou art



    THE PEACE OF EUROPE

    Great peace in Europe  Order reigns
    From Tibers hills to Danubes plains

    Go lay to earth a listening ear
    The tramp of measured marches hear
    The rolling of the cannon
    The shotted muskets murderous peal
    The night alarm the sentry
    The piickeared spy in hut and hall
    From Polar sea and tropic fen
    The dyinggroans of exiled men
    s chains
    The scaffold smoking with its stains
    Order the hush of brooding slaves
    Peace in the dungeonvaults and graves

    O Fisher  of the worldwide net
    W
    Whose fabled keys of heaven and hell
    Bolt hard the patriots prisoncell
    And open wide the banquethall

    Weak vassal tricked in royal guise

    Boy Kaiser with thy lip of lies

    Base gambler for Napoleon

    Barnacle on his dead renown

    Thou Bourbon Neapolitan

    Crowned scandal loathed of God and man

    And thou fell Spider of the North

    Stretching thy giant feelers forth

    Witliin whose web the freedom dies

    Of nations eaten up like flies

    Speak Prince and Kaiser Priest and

    Czar
    If this be Peace pray what is War

    White Angel of the Lord  unmeet

    That soil accursed for thy pure feet

    Never in Slaverys desert flows

    The fountain of thy charmed repose

    No tyrant

    Of lilies and of oliveleaves

    Not with the wicked shalt thou dwell

    Thus saith the Eternal Oracle

    Thy home is with the pure and free

    Stern herald of thy better day

    Before thee to prepare thy way

    The Baptist Shade of Liberty

    Gray scarred and hairyrobed must press

    With bleeding feet the wilderness

    Oh that its voice might pierce the ear

    Of princes trembling while they hear

    A cry as of the Hebrew seer

    Repent  Gods kingdom draweth near

    THE DISENTHRALLED

    He had bowed down to drunkenness

    An abject worshijjper
    The pride of manhoods pidse had grown

    Too faint and cold to stir
    And he had given his spirit up

    To the unblessed thrall
    And bowing to the poison cup

    He gloried in his fall

    There came a change  the cloud rolled off

    And light fell on his brain
    And like the passing of a dream

    That cometh not again
    The shadow of the spirit fled

    He saw the gulf before
    He shuddered at the waste behind

    And was a man once moie

    He shook the serpent folds away

    That gatliered round his heart
    As shakes the swaying forestoak

    Its poison vine apart
    He stood erect  returning pride

    Grew terrible within
    And conscience sat in judgment on

    His most familiar sin

    The light of Intellect again

    Along his pathway shone
    And Reason like a monarch sat

    Upon his olden throne



    The honored and the wise once more
    Within his presence came

    And lingered oft on lovely lips
    His once forbidden name

    There may be glory in the might

    That treadeth nations down

    The proudest now is but my peer

    The highest not more high
    Today of all tlie weary year

    A king of men am I
    Today alike are great and small

    The nameless and the known
    My palace is the people

    The ballotbox my throne

    Who serves today upon the list

    Beside the served shall stand
    Alike the brown and wrinkled fist

    The gloved and dainty hand
    The rich is level with the poor

    The weak is strong todaj
    And sleekest broadcloth counts no more

    Than homespun frock of gray

    Today let pomp and vain pretence

    My stubborn right abide
    I set a plain mans common sense

    Against the pedant
    Today shall simple manhood try

    The strength of gold and land
    The wide world has not wealth to buy

    The power in my right hand

    While there s a grief to seek redress

    Or balance to adjust
    Where weighs our living manhood less

    Tlian Mammon
    While there s a right to need my vote

    A wrong to sweep away
    Up  clouted knee and ragged coat

    THE DREAM OF PIO NONO

    THE DREAM OF PIO NONO

    It chanced that while the pious troops of
    France
    Fought in the crusade Pio Nono preached
    What time the holy Bourbons stayed his

    hands
    The Hur and Aaron meet for such a

    Moses
    Stretched forth from Naples towards rebel
    lious Rome
    To bless the ministry of Oudinot
    And sanctify his iron homilies
    And sharp persuasions of the bayonet
    That the great pontiff fell asleep and
    dreamed

    He stood by Lake Tiberias in the sun
    Of the bright Orient  and beheld the

    lame
    s

    feet
    And rise up whole And sweetly over

    all
    Dropping the ladder of their hymn of praise
    From heaven to earth in silver rounds of

    song
    He heard the blessed angels sing of peace
    Goodwill to man and glory to the Lord

    Then one Avith feet unshod and leathern

    face
    Hardened and darkened by fierce summer

    suns
    And hot winds of the desert closer drew
    His fisher
    And spake as one who had authority
    Come thou with me

    Lakeside and eastern sky
    And the sweet song of angels passed away
    And with a dreams alacrity of change
    The priest and the swart fisher by his

    side
    Beheld the Eternal City lift its domes
    And solemn fant
    Above the waste Campagna On the hills
    The blaze of burning villas rose and fell
    s iron throat
    Roared from the trenches  and within the

    walls
    Sharp crash of shells low groans of human

    pain



    Shout drum beat and the clanging larum

    bell
    And tramp of hosts sent up a mingled

    sound
    Half wail and half defiance As they passed
    The gate of San Pancrazio human blood
    Flowed anklehigh about them and dead

    men
    Choked the long street with gashed and

    gory piles
    A ghastly barricade of mangled flesh
    From which at times quivered a living

    hand
    And white lips moved and moaned A

    father tore
    His gray hairs by the body of his son
    In frenzy  and his fair yoimg daughter

    wept
    On his old bosom Suddenly a flash
    Clove the thick sulphurous air and man

    and maid
    Sank crushed and mangled by the shatter
    ing shell

    Then spake the Galilean
    seen

    The blessed Master and His works of love

    Look now on tliine  Hearst thou the
    angels sing

    Above this open hell  Thou Gods high
    priest

    Thou the Vicegerent of the Prince of Peace

    Thou the successor of His chosen ones

    I Peter fisherman of Galilee

    In the dear Masters name and for the
    love

    Of His true Church proclaim thee Anti
    christ

    Alien and separate from His holy faith

    Wide as the difference between death and
    life

    The hate of man and the great love of God

    Hence and repent

    Thereat the pontiff woke
    Trembling and muttering o

    dream
    What means he   cried the Bourbon

    Nothing more
    Thau that your majesty hath all too well
    Catered for your poor guests and that in

    sooth
    The Holy Fathers supper troubleth him

    THE VOICES

    Why urge the long unequal fight
    Since Truth has fallen in the street

    Or lift anew the trampled light

    Quenched by the heedless million

    Give oer the thankless task  forsake
    The fools who know not ill from good

    Eat drink enjoy thy own and take
    Thine ease among the multitude

    Live out thyself  with others share
    Thy proper life no more  assume

    The unconcern of sun and air

    For life or death or blight or bloom

    The mountain pine looks calmly on

    The fires that scourge the plains be
    low

    Nor heeds the eagle in the sun

    The small birds piping in the snow

    The world is Gods not thine  let Him
    Work out a change if change must be

    The hand that planted best can trim
    And nurse the old unfruitful tree

    So spake the Tempter when the light
    Of sun and stars had left the sky

    I listened through the cloud and niglit
    And heard methought a voice reply

    That task may well seem overhard
    Who scatterest in a thankless soil

    Thy life as seed with no reward
    Save that which Duty gives to Toil

    Not wholly is thy heart resigned
    To Heavens benign and just decree

    Which linking thee with all thy kind
    Transmits their joys and griefs to thee

    Break off that sacred chain and turn
    Back on thyself thy love and care

    Be thou thine own mean idol burn

    Faith Hope and Trust thy children
    there

    Released from that fraternal law

    Which shares the common bale and bliss

    No sadder lot could Folly draw

    Or Sin provoke from Fate than this



    The meal unshared is food unblest
    Thou hoard
    spend

    Selfease is pain  thy only rest
    Is labor for a worthy end

    A toil that gains with what it yields
    And scatters to its own increase

    And hears while sowing outward fields
    The harvestsong of inward jjeace

    Freelipped the liberal streamlets run
    Free shines for all the healthful ray

    The still pool stagnates in the sun
    The lurid earthfire haunts decay

    What is it that the crowd requite

    Thy love with hate thy truth with lies

    And but to faith and not to sight
    The walls of Freedoms temple rise

    Yet do thy work  it shall succeed

    In thine or in anothers day
    And if denied the victors meed

    Thou shalt not lack the toilers pay

    Faith shares the futures promise  Loves
    Selfoffering is a triumph won

    And each good thought or action moves
    The dark world nearer to the sun

    Then faint not falter not nor plead
    Thy weakness  truth itself is strong

    The lions strength the eagles sjjeed
    Are not alone vouchsafed to wrong

    Thy nature which through fire and flood
    To place or gain finds out its way

    Hath power to seek the highest good
    And duty

    Strivest thou in darkness   foes with
    out

    In league with traitor thoughts within
    Thy nightwatch kept with trembling Doubt

    Aiad pale Remorse the ghost of Sin

    Hast thou not on some week of storm
    Seen the sweet Sabbath breaking fair

    And cloud and shadow sunlit form
    The curtains of its tent of prayer

    So haply when thy task shall end
    The wrong shall lose itself in right

    THE NEW EXODUS

    Written upon hearing that slavery had been
    formally abolished in Egypt Unhappily the
    professions and pledges of the vacillating gov
    ernment of Egypt proved iimeliable

    By fire and cloud across the desert sand
    And through the parted waves

    From their long bondage with an out
    stretched hand
    God led the Hebrew slaves

    Dead as the letter of the Pentateuch

    As Egypts statues cold
    In the adytum of the sacred book

    Now stands that marvel old

    Lo God is great   the simple Moslem
    says
    We seek the ancient date
    Turn the dry scroll and make that living
    phrase
    A dead one

    And like the Coptic monks by Mousa
    wells
    We dream of wonders past
    Vague as the tales the wandering Arab
    tells
    Each drowsier than the last

    O fools and blind  Above the Pyramids
    Stretches once more that hand

    And tranced Egypt from her stony lids
    Flings back her veil of sand

    And morning  smitten Memnon singing
    wakes
    And listening by his Nile
    Oer Amnion
    breaks
    A sweet and human smile

    Not as before with hail and fire and call
    Of death for midnight graves

    But in the stillness of the noonday fall
    The fetters of the slaves

    No longer through the Red Sea as of old
    The bondmen walk dry shod



    Through human hearts by love of Him
    controlled
    Runs now that path of God

    And the fenlands of the Wetter

    But where the low gray headlands

    Look o
    A bark is sailing in the track

    Of Englands battleline

    No wares hath she to barter
    For Bothnia

    She saileth not for pleasure
    She saileth not for gain

    But still by isle or mainland
    She drops her anchor down

    Whereer the British cannon
    Rained fire on tower and town

    Outspake the ancient Amtman
    At the gate of Helsingfors
    Why comes this ship aspying

    In the track of Englands wars

    God bless her said the coastguard
    God bless the ship I say
    The holy angels trim the sails
    That speed her on her way

    Where
    The peasants heart is glad
    Where
    Tlie peasants heart is sad

    Each wasted town and hamlet
    She visits to restore
    To roof the shattered cabin
    And feed the starving poor

    And that the children of the light
    Shall tread the darkness under foot

    I know the pent fire heaves its crust
    That sultry skies the bolt will form
    To smite them clear  that Nature must
    The balance of her powers adjust

    Though with the earthquake and the
    storm

    God reigns and let the earth rejoice

    I bow before His sterner plan
    Dumb are the organs of my choice
    He speaks in battles stormy voice

    His praise is in the wrath of man

    Yet surely as He lives the day

    Of peace He promised shall be ours
    To fold the flags of war and lay
    Its sword and spear to rust away

    And sow its ghastly fields with flowers



    FREEDOM IN BRAZIL

    With clearer light Cross of the South
    shine forth
    In blue Brazilian skies
    And thou O river cleaving half the earth

    From sunset to sunrise
    From the great mountains to the Atlantic
    waves
    Thy joys long anthem pour
    Yet a few years God make them less
    and slaves
    Shall shame thy pride no more



    No fettered feet thy shaded margins press

    But all men shall walk free
    Where thou the highpriest of the wilder
    ness

    Hast wedded sea to sea

    And thou greathearted ruler through
    whose mouth
    The word of God is said
    Once moie  Let there be light
    of the South
    Lift up thy honored head
    Wear unashamed a crown by thy desert

    More than by birth thy own
    Careless of watch and ward  thou art
    begirt
    By grateful hearts alone
    The moated wall and battle ship may fail

    But safe shall justice prove
    Stronger than greaves of brass or iron
    mail
    The panoply of love

    Crowned doubly by mans blessing and
    Gods grace

    Thy future is secure
    Who frees a people makes his statues place

    In Times Valhalla sure
    Lo  from his Nevas banks the Scythian
    Czar

    Stretches to thee his hand
    Who with the pencil of the Northern star

    Wrote freedom on his land
    And he whose grave is holy by our calm

    And prairied Sangamon
    From his gaunt hand shall drop the mar
    tyrs palm

    To greet thee with  Well done

    And thou O Earth with smiles thy face
    make sweet

    And let thy wail be stilled
    To hear the Muse of prophecy repeat

    Her promise half fulfilled
    The Voice that spake at Nazareth speaks
    still

    No sound thereof hath died
    Alike thy hope and Heavens eternal will

    Shall yet be satisfied
    The years are slow the vision tarrieth
    long

    And far the end may be
    But one by one the fiends of ancient wrong

    Go out and leave thee free

    AFTER ELECTION

    The days sharp strife is ended now
    Our work is done God knoweth how
    As on the thronged unrestful town
    The patience of the moon looks down
    I wait to hear beside tlie wire
    The voices of its tongues of fire

    Slow doubtful faint they seem at first
    Be strong my heart to know the worst
    Hark  there the Alleghanies spoke
    That sound from lake and prairie broke
    That sunsetgun of triumph rent
    The silence of a continent

    That signal from Nebraska sprung

    This from Nevadas mountain tongue

    Is that thy answer strong and free

    O loyal heart of Tennessee

    What strange glad voice is that which calls

    From Wagners grave and Sumters walls

    From Mississippis fountainhead
    A sound as of the bisons tread
    There rustled freedoms Charter Oak
    In that wild burst the Ozarks spoke 1
    Cheer answers cheer from rise to set
    Of sun We have a country yet

    The praise O God be thine alone
    Thou givest not for bread a stone
    Thou hast not led us through the night
    To blind us with returning light
    Not through the furnace have we passed
    To perish at its mouth at last

    O night of peace thy flight restrain

    Once on the errands of his mercy bent
    Buddha the holy and benevolent
    Met a fell monster huge and fierce of

    Whose awful voice the hills and forests

    shook
    O son of peace   the giant cried  thy

    fate
    Is sealed at last and love shall yield to

    hate
    The unarmed Buddha looking with no

    trace
    Of fear or anger in the monsters face
    In pity said   Poor fiend even thee I

    Lo  as he spake the skytall terror sank
    To handbreadth size  the huge abhorrence

    shrank
    Into the form and fashion of a dove
    And where the thunder of its rage was

    Circling above him sweetly sang the bird

    We give thy natal day to hope

    O Country of our love and prayer I

    Thy way is down no fatal slope
    But up to freer sun and air

    Tried as by furnacefires and yet
    By Gods grace only stronger made

    In future tasks before thee set

    Thou shalt not lack the oldtime aid



    The fathers sleep but men remain
    As wise as true and brave as they

    Why count the loss and not the gain
    The best is that we have today

    Whateer of folly shame or crime
    Within thy mighty bounds tianspires

    With speed defying space and time
    Comes to us on the accusing wires

    While of thy wealth of noble deeds
    Thy homes of peace thy votes unsold

    The love that pleads for human needs
    The wrong redressed but half is told

    We read each felons chronicle

    Belted with flowers Los Angeles

    To where Katahdins cedar trees

    Are dwarfed and bent by Northern winds
    Thy plentys horn is yearly filled

    Alone the rounding century finds
    Thy liberal soil by free hands tilled

    A refuge for the wronged and poor

    Thy generous heart has borne the blame

    That with them through thy open door
    The old worlds evil outcasts came

    But with thy just and equal rule

    And labors need and breadth of lands

    Free press and rostrum church and school
    Thy sure if slow transforming hands

    Shall mould even them to thy design
    Making a blessing of the ban

    And Freedoms chemistry combine
    The alien elements of man

    The power that broke their prison bar

    ON THE BIG HORN

    In the disastrous battle on the Big Horn
    River in which General Custer and his entire
    force were slain the chief RainintheFace
    was one of the fiercest leaders of the Indians
    In Longfellows poem on the massacre these
    lines will be remembered

    Revenge
    Revenge upon all the race

    Of the White Chief with yellow hair
    And the mountains dark and high
    From their crags reechoed the cry
    Of his anger and despair

    He is now a man of peace  and the agent at
    Standing Rock Dakota writes September 2S
    1885    RainintheFace is very anxious to go
    to Hampton I fear he is too old but he desires
    very much to go The Southern Vorkman the
    organ of General Armstrong
    at Hampton Va says in a late number

    RainintheFace has applied before to
    come to Hampton but his age would exclude
    him from the school as an ordinary student
    He has shown himself very much in earnest
    about it and is anxious all say to learn the
    better ways of life It is as tinusual as it is
    striking to see a man of his age and one who
    has had such an experience willing to give up
    the old way and put himself in the position of
    a boy and a student

    The years are but half a score
    And the warwhoop sounds no more

    With the blast of bugles where
    Straight into a slaughter pen
    With his doomed three hundred men

    Rode the chief with the yellow hair

    O Hampton down by the sea
    What voice is beseeching thee

    For the scholars lowliest place
    Can this be the voice of him
    Who fought on the Big Horn

    Can this be RainintheFace

    His warpaint is washed away
    His hands liave forgotten to slay

    He seeks for himself and his race
    The arts of peace and the lore
    That give to the skilled hand more

    Than the spoils of war and chase



    ON THE BIG HORN



    385



    O chief of the Christlike school
    Can the zeal of thy heart grow cool

    When the victor scarred with fight
    Like a child for thy guidance craves
    And the faces of hunters and braves

    Are turning to thee for light

    The hatchet lies overgrown
    With grass by the Yellowstone

    Wind River and Paw of Bear
    And in sign that foes are friends
    Each lodge like a peacepipe sends

    Its smoke in the quiet air

    The hands that have done the wrong
    To right the wronged are strong
    And the voice of a nation saith
    Enough of the war of swords
    Enough of the lying words

    And shame of a broken faith



    The hills that have watched afar
    The valleys ablaze with war

    Shall look on the tasselled corn
    And the dust of the grinded grain
    Instead of the blood of the slain

    Shall sprinkle thy banks Big Horn

    The Ute and the wandering Crow
    Shall know as the white men know

    And fare as the white men fare
    The pale and the red shall be brothers
    Ones rights shall be as another

    Home School and House of Prayer

    O mountains that climb to snow
    O river winding below

    Through meadows by war once trod
    O wild waste lands that await
    The harvest exceeding great

    Break forth into praise of God



    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    MEMORIES

    It was not without thought and delibera
    tion Whittiers biographer writes
    1888 he directed this poem to be placed at the
    head of his Poems Subjective and Reminiscent
    He had never before publicly acknowledged
    how much of his heart was wiapped up in this
    delightful play of poetic fancy The poem was
    written in 1841 and although the romance it
    embalms lies far back of this date possibly
    there is a heart still beating which fully under
    stands its meaning The biographer can do no
    more than make this suggestion which has the
    sanction of the poets explicit word To a friend
    who told him that Memories was her favorite
    poem he said  I love it too  but I hardly
    knev whether to publish it it was so personal
    and near my heart

    A BEAUTIFUL and happy girl

    With step as light as summer air
    Eyes glad with smiles and brow of pearl
    Shadowed by many a caieless curl

    Of imconfined and flowing hair
    A seeming child in everything

    Save thoughtful brow and ripening
    charms
    As Nature wears the smile of Spring

    When sinking uito Summer

    A mind rejoicing in the light

    Which melted through its graceful
    bower
    Leaf after leaf dewmoist and bright
    And stainless in its holy white

    Unfolding like a morning flower
    A heart which like a finetoned lute

    With every breath of feeling woke
    And even when the tongue was mute

    From eye and lip in music spoke

    How thrills once more the lengthening
    chain

    Of memory at the thought of thee
    Old hopes which long in dust have lain
    Old dreams come thronging back again

    And boyhood lives again in me



    I feel its glow upon my cheek
    Its fulness of the heart is mine

    As when I leaned to hear thee speak
    Or raised my doubtful eye to thine

    I hear again thy low replies

    I feel thy arm within my own
    And timidly again uprise
    The fringed lids of hazel eyes

    With soft brown tresses overblown
    Ah  memories of sweet summer eves

    Of moonlit wave and willowy way
    Of stars and flowers and dewy leaves

    And smiles and tones more dear than
    they

    Ere this thy quiet eye hath smiled

    My picture of thy youth to see
    When half a woman half a child
    Thy very artlessness beguiled

    And follys self seemed wise in thee
    I too can smile when o

    The lights of memory backward stream
    s power

    Is vainer than my boyhood

    Years have passed on and left their trace

    Of graver care and deeper thought
    And unto me the calm cold face
    Of manhood and to thee the grace

    Of womans pensive beauty brought
    More wide perchance for blame than
    praise

    The schoolboy
    Thine in the green and quiet ways

    Of unobtrusive goodness known

    And wider yet in thought and deed

    Diverge our pathways one in youth
    Thine the Genevans sternest creed
    While answers to my spirit

    The Derby dalesmans simple truth
    For thee the priestly rite and prayer

    And holy day and solemn psalm
    For me the silent reverence where

    My brethren gather slow and calm

    Yet hath tliy spirit left on me

    An impress Time has worn not out
    And something of myself in thee
    A shadow from the past I see

    Lingering even yet thy way about
    Not wholly can tlie heart unlearn

    That lesson of its better hours
    Not yet has Time

    To common dust that path of flowers

    Thus while at times before our eyes

    The shadows melt and fall apart
    And smiling through them round us lies
    The warm light of our morning skies

    The Indian Summer of the heart
    In secret sympathies of mind

    In founts of feeling which retain
    Their pure fresh flow we yet may find

    Our early dreams not wholly vain

    RAPHAEL

    Suggested by the portrait of Raphael at the
    age of fifteen

    I SHALL not soon forget that sight
    The glow of Autumns westering day

    A hazy warmth a dreamy light
    On Raphael

    H was a simple print I saw

    The fair face of a musing boy

    Yet while I gazed a sense of awe
    Seemed bending with my joy

    A single print  the graceful flow
    Of boyhoods soft and wavy hair

    And fresh young lip and cheek and brow
    Unmarked and clear were there

    Yet through its sweet and calm repose
    I saw the inward spirit shine

    It was as if before me rose
    The white veil of a shrine

    As if as Gothland
    The hidden life the man within

    Dissevered from its frame and mould
    By mortal eye were seen

    Was it the lifting of that eye

    The waving of tliat pictured hand

    Loose as a cloixdvreath on the sky
    I saw the walls expand



    The narrow room liad vanished  space
    Broad luminous remained alone

    Through which all hues and shapes of grace
    And beauty looked or shone

    Around the mighty master came

    The marvels which his pencil wrought

    Those miracles of power whose fame
    Is wide as human thought

    There drooped thy more than mortal face
    O Mother beautiful and mild

    Enfolding in one dear embrace
    Thy Saviour and thy Child

    The rapt brow of the Desert John

    The awful glory of that day
    When all the Fathers brightness shone

    Through manhood

    And midst gray prophet forms and wild
    Dark visions of the days of old

    How sweetly womans beauty smiled
    Through locks of brown and gold

    There Fornarina
    Once more upon her lover shone

    s grace
    He borrowed from her own

    Slow passed tliat vision from my view
    But not the lesson which it taught

    The soft calm shadows which it threw
    Still rested on my thought

    The truth that painter bard and sage
    Even in Earth

    Plant for their deathless heritage
    The fruits and flowers of time

    We shape ourselves the joy or fear
    Of which the coming life is made

    And fill our Futures atmosphere
    With sunshine or with shade

    The tissue of the Life to be

    We weave with colors all our own

    And in the field of Destiny
    We reap as we have sown

    Still shall the soul around it call

    The shadows which it gathered here

    And painted on the eternal wall
    The Past shall reappear

    For ever as these lines I penned

    Still with the thought of thee will blend

    That of some loved and common friend

    Who in life
    His pilgrim tent with mine or strayed
    Beneath the same remembered shade

    And hence my pen unfettered moves
    In freedom which the heart approves
    The negligence which friendship loves

    And wilt thou prize my poor gift less
    For simjjle air and rustic dress
    And sign of haste and carelessness

    Oh more than specious counterfeit

    Of sentiment or studied wit

    A heart like thine should value it

    Yet half I far my gift will be
    Unto thy book if not to thee
    Of more than doubtful courtesy

    s sphere

    A lay unheard of Beauty

    Forbid disowned  what do they here

    Upon my ear not all in vain

    Came the sad captives clanking chain

    The groaning from his bed of pain



    And sadder still I saw the woe
    Which only wounded spirits know
    When Prides strong footsteps oer them
    go

    Spurued not alone in walks abroad
    But from the temples of the Lord
    Thrust out apart like things abhorred

    Deep as I felt and stern and strong

    In words which Prudence smothered long

    My soul spoke out against the wrong

    Not mine alone the task to speak
    Of comfort to the poor and weak
    And dry the tear on Sorrow

    But mingled in the conflict warm
    To pour the fiery breath of storm
    Through the harsh trumpet of Reform

    To brave Opinions settled frown
    From ermined robe and saintly gown
    While wrestling reverenced Error down

    Founts gushed beside my pilgrim way
    Cool shadows on the greensward laj
    Flowers swung upon the bending spray

    And broad and bright on either hand
    Stretched the green slopes of Fairyland
    With Hope

    Whence voices called me like the flow
    Which on the listeners ear will grow
    Of forest streamlets soft and low

    And gentle eyes which still retain
    Their picture on the heart and brain
    Smiled beckoning from that path of jjain

    In vain  nor dream nor rest nor pause
    Remain for him who round him draws
    The battered mail of Freedom

    From youthful hopes from each green

    spot
    Of young Romance and gentle Thought
    Where storm and tumult enter not

    From each fair altar where belong
    The offerings Love requires of Song
    In homage to her brighteyed throng



    EGO



    389



    With soul and strength with heart and

    hand
    I turned to Freedoms struggling band
    To the sad Helots of our land

    What marvel then that Fame should turn
    Her notes of praise to those of scorn
    Her gifts reclaimed her smiles with
    drawn

    What matters it  a few years more
    Life
    Shall break upon the unknown shore

    In that far land shall disappear
    The shadows which we follow here
    The mistwreaths of our atmosphere

    Before no work of mortal hand
    Of human will or strength expand
    The pearl gates of the Better Land

    Alone in that great love which gave
    Life to the sleeper of the grave
    Resteth the power to seek and save

    Yet if the spirit gazing through

    The vista of the past can view

    One deed to Heaven and virtue true

    If through the wreck of wasted powers
    s bowers
    Of idle aims and misspent hours

    The eye can note one sacred spot

    By Pride and Self profaned not

    A green place in the waste of thought

    Where deed or word hath rendered less
    The sum of human wretchedness
    And Gratitude looks forth to bless

    The simple burst of tenderest feeling
    Froni sad hearts worn by evildealing
    For blessing on the hand of healing

    Better than Glory
    That green and blessed spot to me
    A palmshade in Eternity

    Something of Time which may invite
    The purified and spiritual sight
    To rest on with a calm delifyht



    And when the summer winds shall sweep
    With their light wings my place of sleep
    And mosses round my headstone creep

    If still as Freedoms rallying sign
    Upon the young heart
    The very tires they caught from mine

    If words my lips once uttered still
    In the calm faith and steadfast will
    Of other hearts their work fulfil

    Perchance with joy the soul may learn
    These tokens and its eye discern
    The fires which on those altars burn

    A marvellous joy tliat even then

    The spirit hath its life again

    In the strong hearts of mortal men

    Take lady then the gift I bring

    No gay and graceful offering

    No floweismile of the laughing spring

    Midst the green buds of Youth

    May
    With Fancys leafenwoven bay
    My sad and sombre gift I lay

    And if it deepens in thy mind

    A sense of suffering humankind

    The outcast and the spiritblind

    Oppressed and spoiled on every side
    By Prejudice and Scorn and Pride
    Life

    Sad mothers mourning oer their trust
    Children by want and misery nursed
    Tasting life

    If to their strong appeals which come
    From fireless hearth and crowded room
    And the close alleys noisome gloom

    Though dark the hands upraised to thee

    In mute beseeching agony

    Thou lendst thy womans sympathy

    Not vainly on thy gentle shrine

    Where Love and Mirth and Friendship

    twine
    Their varied gifts I offer mine

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    THE PUMPKIN

    Oh greenly and fair in the lands of the
    snn

    The vines of the gourd and the rich melon
    run

    And the rock and the tree and the cottage
    enfold

    With broad leaves all greenness and blos
    soms all gold

    Like that which oer Ninevehs prophet once
    grew

    While he waited to know that his warning
    was true

    And longed for the stormcloud and lis
    tened in vain

    For the rush of the whirlwind and red fire
    rain

    On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish

    maiden
    Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine

    laden
    And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to be
    hold
    Througli orangeleaves shining the broad

    spheres of gold
    Yet with dearer delight from his home in

    the North
    On the fields of his harvest the Yankee

    looks forth
    Where crooknecks are coiling and yellow

    fruit shines
    And the sun of September melts down on

    his vines

    Ah  on Thanksgiving day when from East
    and from West

    From North and from South come the pil
    grim and guest

    When the grayhaired New Englander sees
    round his board

    The old broken links of affection restored

    When the carewearied man seeks his mo
    ther once more

    And the worn matron smiles where the girl
    smiled before

    What moistens the lip and what brightens
    the eye

    What calls back the past like the rich
    Pumpkin pie

    Oh fruit loved of boyhood  the old days
    recalling



    When woodgrapes were purpling and

    brown nuts were falling
    When wild ugly faces we carved in its

    skin
    Glaring out through the dark with a caudle

    within
    When we laughed round the cornheap

    with liearts all in tune
    Our chair a broad pumpkin  our lantern

    the moon
    Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like

    steam
    In a pumpkinshell coach with two rats for

    her team

    Then thanks for thy present  none sweeter
    or better

    E
    llatter

    Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry
    more fine

    er its bak
    ing than thine

    And the prayer which my mouth is too
    full to express

    Swells my heart that thy shadow may
    never be less

    That the days of thy lot may be length
    ened below

    And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin
    vine gl

    And thy life be as sweet and its last sun
    set sky

    Goldentinted and fair as thy own Pumpkin
    pie



    FORGIVENESS

    My heart was heavy for its trust had
    been
    Abused its kindness answered with foul
    wrong
    So turning gloomily from my fellow
    men
    One summer Sabbath day I strolled
    among
    The green mounds of the village burial
    place
    Where pondering how all human love

    and hate
    Find one sad level  and how soon or
    late
    Wronged and wrongdoer each with meek
    ened face



    MY THANKS

    And cold hands folded over a still heart
    Pass the green threshold of our common
    grave
    Whither all footsteps tend whence none
    depart
    Awed for myself and pitying my race
    Our common sorrow like a mighty wave
    Swept all my pride away and trembling I
    forgave



    TO MY SISTER

    WITH A COPY OF THE SUPERNATU
    RALISM OF NEW ENGLAND

    The work referred to was a series of papers
    under this title contributed to the Democratic
    Review and afterward collected into a volume
    in which I noted some of the superstitions and
    folklore prevalent in New England The vol
    ume has not been kept in print but most of
    its contents are distributed in my Literary
    Recreations and Miscellanies now scattered in
    volumes v and vi of the Riverside edition

    Dear Sister  while the wise and sage
    Turn coldly from my playful page
    And count it strange that ripened age

    s folly
    I know that thou wilt judge aright
    Of all which makes the heart more light
    Or lends one stargleam to the night

    Of clouded Melancholy

    Away with weary cares and themes
    Swing vnde the moonlit gate of dreams
    Leave free once more the land which
    teems

    With wonders and romances
    Where thou with clear discerning eyes
    Shalt rightly read the truth which lies
    Beneath the quaintly masking guise

    Of wild and wizard fancies

    Lo  once again our feet we set

    On still green woodpaths twilight wet

    By lonely brooks whose waters fret

    The roots of spectral beeches
    Again the hearthfire glimmers o
    Homes whitewashed wall and painted

    floor
    And young eyes widening to the lore

    Of faeryfolks and witches



    Dear heart  the legend is not vain
    Which lights that holy hearth again
    And calling back from care and pain

    And death
    Draws round its old familiar blaze
    The clustering groups of happier days
    s gaze

    A glimpse of childish gladness

    And knowing how my life hath been

    A weary work of tongue and pen

    A long harsh strife with strongwilled men

    Thou wilt not chide my turning
    To con at times an idle rhyme
    To pluck a flower from childhood
    Or listen at Lifes noonday chime

    For the sweet bells of Morning

    SENTED TO A FRIEND

    Formerly entitled Lines

    T IS said that in the Holy Land

    The angels of the place have blessed

    The pilgrims bed of desert sand
    Like Jacob

    That down the hush of Syrian skies

    Some sweetvoiced saint at twilight sings

    The song whose holy symphonies
    Are beat by unseen wings

    Till starting from his sandy bed
    The wayworn wanderer looks to see

    The halo of an angels head

    Shine through the tamarisktree

    So through the shadows of my way
    Thy smile hath fallen soft and clear

    So at the weary close of day
    Hath seemed thy voice of cheer

    That pilgrim pressing to his goal
    May pause not for the vision

    Yet all fair things within his soul
    The thought of it shall wake

    The graceful palmtree by the well
    s rim

    The dark eyes of the fleet gazelle
    Bent timidly on him

    Each pictured saint whose golden hair
    Streams sunlilce through the convent
    gloom

    Pale shrines of martyrs young and fair
    And loving Marys tomb

    And thus each tint or shade which falls
    From sunset cloud or waving tree

    Along my pilgrim path recalls
    The pleasant thought of thee

    Of one in sun and shade the same
    In weal and woe my steady friend

    Whatever by that holy name
    ITie angels comprehend

    Not blind to faults and follies thou
    Hast never failed the good to see

    Nor judged by one unseemly bough
    The upwardstruggling tree

    These light leaves at thy feet I lay
    Poor common thoughts on common
    things

    Which Time is shaking day by day
    Like feathers from his wings

    Chance shootings from a frail lifetree
    To nurturing care but little known

    Their good was partly learned of thee
    Their folly is my own

    That tree still clasps the kindly mould
    Its leaves still drink the twilight dew

    And weaving its pale green with gold
    Still shines the sunlight through

    There still the morning zephyrs play
    And there at times the spring bird
    sings

    And mossy trunk and fading spray
    Are flowered with glossy wings

    Yet even in genial sun and rain

    Root branch and leaflet fail and fade

    The wanderer on its lonely plain
    Erelong shall miss its shade

    O friend beloved whose curious skill

    Keeps bright the last year
    flowers
    With warm glad summer thoughts to
    fill
    The cold dark winter hours



    Pressed on thy heart the leaves I bring
    May well defy the wintry cold

    Until in Heavens eternal spring

    WRITINGS

    Friend of mine  whose lot was cast
    With me in the distant past
    Where like shadows flitting fast

    Fact and fancy thought and theme
    Word and work begin to seem
    Like a halfremembered dream

    Touched by change have all things been
    Yet I think of thee as when
    We had speech of lip and pen

    For the calm thy kindness lent
    To a path of discontent
    Rough with trial and dissent

    Gentle words where such were few
    Softening blame where blame was true
    Praising where small praise was due

    For a waking dream made good

    For an ideal understood

    For thy Christian womanhood

    For thy marvellous gift to cull
    From our common life and dull

    In superfluous zeal bestowing
    Gifts where gifts are overflowing

    393



    To thy full thoughts gay or sad
    Sunnyhued or sober clad
    Something of my own I add

    Well assured that thou wilt take
    Even the offering which I make
    Kindly for the givers sake



    MY NAMESAKE

    Addressed to Francis Greenleaf Allison of
    Burlington N J

    You scarcely need ray tardy thanks
    Who selfrewarded nurse and tend

    A green leaf on your own Green Banks
    The memory of your friend

    For me no wreath bloomwoven hides
    The sobered brow and lessening hair

    For aught I know the myrtled sides
    Of Helicon are bare

    Their scallopshells so many bring
    The fabled founts of song to try

    They
    spring
    Of Aganippe dry

    Ah well   The wreath the Muses braid
    Proves often Follys cap and bell

    Methinks mj ample beaver
    May serve my turn as well

    Let Loves and Friendship
    Be paid by those I love in life

    Why should the unborn critic whet
    For me his scalpingknife

    Why should the stranger peer and pry
    Ones vacant house of life about

    And drag for curious ear and eye
    His faults and follies out

    Why stuff for fools to gaze upon

    With chaff of words the garb he wore

    As cornhusks when the ear is gone
    Are rustled all the more

    Let kindly Silence close again
    The picture vanish from the eye

    And on the dim and misty main
    Let the small ripple die



    Yet not the less I own your claim

    To grateful thanks dear friends of mine

    Hang if it please you so my name
    Upon your household line

    Let Fame from brazen lips blow wide
    Her chosen names I envy none

    A mothers love a fathers pride
    Shall keep alive my own

    Still shall that name as now recall

    The young leaf wet with morning dew

    The glory where the sunbeams fall
    The breezy woodlands through

    That name shall be a household word
    A spell to waken smile or sigh

    In many an evening prayer be heard
    And cradle lullaby

    And thou dear child in riper days
    Wlien asked the reason of thy name

    Shalt answer
    Or censure bore the same

    Some blamed him some believed him
    good

    The truth lay doubtless
    He reconciled as best he could

    Old faith and fancies new

    In him the grave and playful mixed
    And wisdom held with folly truce

    And Nature compromised betwixt
    Good fellow and recluse

    He loved his friends forgave his foes

    And if his words were harsh at times
    He spared his fellowmen  his blows

    Fell only on their crimes

    He loved the good and wise but found

    His human heart to all akin
    Who met him on the common ground

    Of suffering and of sin

    Whateer his neighbors might endure
    Of pain or grief his own became

    For all the ills he could not cure
    He held himself to blame

    His good was mainly an intent
    His evil not of forethought done

    The work he wrought was rarely meant
    Or finished as begun

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    111 served his tides of feeling strong
    To turn the common mills of use

    And over restless wings of song
    His birthright garb hnng loose

    His eye was beautys powerless slave
    And his the ear which discord pains

    Few guessed beneath his aspect grave
    What passions strove in chains

    He had his share of care and pain

    No holiday was life to him
    Still in the heirloom cup we drain

    The bitter drop will swim

    Yet Heaven was kind and here a bird
    And there a flower beguiled his way

    And cool in summer noons he heard
    The fountains plash and play

    On all his sad or restless moods
    The patient peace of Nature stole

    The quiet of the fields and woods
    Sauk deep into his soid

    He worshipped as his fathers did
    And kept the faith of childish days

    And howsoeer he strayed or slid
    He loved the good old ways

    The simple tastes the kindly traits
    The tranquil air and gentle speech

    The silence of the soul that waits
    For more than man to teach

    The cant of party school and sect
    Provoked at times his honest scorn

    And Folly in its gray respect
    He tossed on satires horn

    But still his heart was full of awe
    And reverence for all sacred things

    And brooding over form and law
    He saw the Spirit

    Lifes mystery wrapt him like a cloud
    He heard far voices mock his own

    The sweep of wings unseen the loud
    Long roll of waves unknown

    The arrows of his straining sight

    Fell quenched in darkness  priest and
    sage

    Like lost guides calling left and right
    Perplexed his doubtful age



    Like childhood listening for the sound
    Of its dropped pebbles in the well

    All vainly down the dark profound
    His briefliiied plummet fell

    So scattering flowers with pious pains

    On old beliefs of later creeds
    Which claimed a place in Truths do
    mains

    He asked the titledeeds

    He saw the oldtime
    In the long distance fair and dim

    And heard like sound of faroff pines
    The centurymellowed hymn

    He dared not mock the Dervish whirl
    The Brahmins rite the Lama

    s pearl
    Might sanctify the shell

    While others trod the altar stairs

    He faltered like the publican
    And while they praised as saints his
    prayers

    Were those of sinful man

    For awed by Sinai
    The trembling faith alone sufficed

    That through its cloud and flame he
    saw
    The sweet sad face of Christ

    And listening with his forehead bowed
    Heard the Divine compassion fill

    Tlie pauses of the trump and cloud
    With whispers small and still

    The words he spake the thoughts he
    penned

    Are mortal as his hand and brain
    s end

    He has not lived in vain

    Heaven make thee better than thy name
    Child of my friends   For thee I
    crave

    What riches never bought nor fame
    To mortal longing gave

    I pray the prayer of Plato old
    God make thee beautiful within

    And let thine eyes the good behold
    In everything save sin

    To serve not rule thy poised mind

    Strong manhood crowning vigorous youth

    Life made by duty epical

    And rhythmic with the truth

    So shall that life the fruitage yield
    Which trees of healing only give

    And greenleafed in the Eternal field
    Of God forever live



    A MEMORY

    The singer in this poem was a daughter of
    Whittiers early friend N P Rogers

    Here while the loom of Winter weaves
    The shroud of flowers and fountains

    I think of thee and summer eves
    Among the Northern mountains

    When thunder tolled the twilights close
    And winds the lake were rude on

    And thou wert singing Co the Yoives
    The bonny yowes of Cluden

    When close and closer hushing breath
    Our circle narrowed round thee

    And smiles and tears made up the wieath
    Wherewith our silence crowned thee

    And strangers all we felt the ties

    Of sisters and of brothers
    Ah  whose of all those kindly eyes

    Now smile upon anothers

    The sport of Time who still apart

    The waifs of life is flinging
    Oh nevermore shall heart to heart

    Draw nearer for that singing

    Yet when the panes are frostystarred
    And twilights fire is gleaming

    I hear the songs of Scotlands bard
    Sound softly through my dreaming

    A song that lends to winter snows
    The glow of summer weather

    Again I hear thee ca the yowes
    To Cludens hills of heather



    MY DREAM

    In my dream methought I trod
    Yesternight a mountain road
    Narrow as Al Sirats span
    High as eagles flight it ran

    Overhead a roof of cloud
    With its weight of thunder bowed
    Underneath to left and right
    Blankness and abysmal night

    Here and there a wildflower blushed
    Now and then a birdsong gushed
    Now and then through rifts of shade
    Stars shone out and sunbeams played

    But the goodly company
    Walking in that path with me
    One by one the brink oerslid
    One by one the darkness hid

    Some with wailing and lament
    Some with cheerful courage went
    But of all who smiled or mourned
    Never one to us returned

    Anxiously with eye and ear
    Questioning that shadow drear
    Never hand in token stirred
    Never answering voice I heard

    Steeper darker   lo  I felt
    From my feet the pathway melt
    Swallowed by the black despair
    And the hungry jaws of air

    Past the stonythroated caves
    Strangled by the wash of waves
    Past the splintered crags I sank
    On a green and flowery bank

    Soft as fall of thistledown
    Lightly as a cloud is blown
    Soothingly as childhood pressed
    To the bosom of its rest

    Of the sharphorned rocks instead
    Green the grassy meadows spread
    Bright with waters singing by
    Trees that propped a golden sky

    Painless trustful sorrowfree
    Old lost faces welcomed me

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    With whose sweetness of content
    Still expectant hope was blent

    Waking while the dawning gray
    Slowly brightened into day
    Pondering that vision fled
    Thus unto myself I said

    Steep and hang with clouds of strife
    Is our narrow path of life
    And our death the dreaded fall
    Through the dark awaiting all

    So with painful steps we climb
    Up the dizzy ways of time
    Ever in the shadow shed
    By the forecast of our dread

    Dread of mystery solved alone
    Of the untried and unknown
    Yet the end thereof may seem
    Like the falling of my dream

    And this heartconsuming care
    All our fears of here or there
    Change and absence loss and death
    Prove but simple lack of faith

    Thou O Most Compassionate
    Who didst stoop to our estate
    Drinking of the cup we drain
    Treading in our path of pain

    Through the doubt and mystery
    Grant to us thy steps to see
    And the grace to draw from thence
    Larger hope and confidence

    Show thy vacant tomb and let
    As of old the angels sit
    Whispering by its open door
    Fear not  He hath gone before



    THE BAREFOOT BOY

    Blessings on thee little man
    Barefoot boy with cheek of tan
    With thy turnedup pantaloons
    And thy merry whistled tunes
    With thy red lip redder still
    Kissed by strawberries on the hill
    With the sunshine on thy face
    Through thy torn brim
    From my heart I give thee joy



    I was once a barefoot boy

    Prince thou art  the grownup man

    Only is republican

    Let the miUiondollared ride

    Barefoot trudging at his side

    Thou hast more than he can buy

    e

    Outward sunshine inward joy

    Blessings on thee barefoot boy

    Oh for boyhood
    Sleep that wakes in laughing day
    s rules
    Knowledge never learned of schools
    Of the wild bee
    Of the wildflowers time and place
    Flight of fowl and habitude
    Of the tenants of the Avood
    How the tortoise bears his shell
    How the woodchuck digs his cell
    And the groundmole sinks his well
    How the robin feeds her young
    How the oriole
    Where the whitest lilies blow
    Where the freshest berries grow
    Where the groundnut trails its vine
    Where the woodgrapes clusters shine
    Of the black wasp
    Mason of his walls of clay
    And the architectural plans
    Of gray hornet artisans
    For eschewing books and tasks
    Nature answers all he asks
    Hand in hand with her he walks
    Face to face with her he talks
    Part and parcel of her joy
    Blessings on the barefoot bo

    Oh for boyhoods time of June
    Crowding years in one brief moon
    When all things I heard or saw
    Me their master waited for
    I was rich in flowers and trees
    Hummingbirds and honeybees
    For my sport the squirrel played
    Plied the snouted mole his spade
    For my taste the blackberry cone
    Purpled over hedge and stone
    Laughed the brook for my delight
    Through tlie day and through the night
    Whispering at the garden wall
    Talked witli me from fall to fall
    Mine the sandrimmed pickerel pond
    Mine the walnut slopes beyond
    Mine on bending orchard trees



    MY PSALM



    397



    Apples of Hesperides
    Still as my horizon grew
    Larger grew my riches too
    All the world I saw or knew
    Seemed a complex Chinese toy
    Fashioned for a barefoot boy

    Oh for festal dainties spread
    Like my bowl of milk and bread
    Pewter spoon and bowl of wood
    On the doorstone gray and rude
    O
    Cloudyribbed tlie sunset bent
    Purplecurtained fringed with gold
    Looped in many a windswung fold
    While for music came the play
    Of the pied frogs orchestra
    And to light the noisy choir
    Lit the fly his lamp of fire
    I was monarch  pomp and joy
    Waited on the barefoot boy

    Cheerily then my little man
    Live and laugh as boyhood can
    Though the flinty slopes be hard
    Stubblespeared the newmown sward
    Every morn shall lead thee through
    Fresh baptisms of the dew
    Evei
    Shall the cool wind kiss the heat
    All too soon these feet must hide
    In the prison cells of pride
    Lose the freedom of the sod
    Like a colts for work be shod
    Made to tread the mills of toil
    Up and down in ceaseless moil
    Happy if their track be found
    Never on forbidden ground
    Happy if they sink not in
    Quick and treacherous sands of sin
    Ah  that thou couldst know thy joy
    Ere it passes barefoot boy

    MY PSALM

    I MOURN no more my vanished years

    Beneath a tender rain
    An April rain of smiles and tears

    My heart is young again

    The westwinds blow and singing low
    I hear the glad streams run

    The windows of my soul I throw
    Wide open to the sun



    No longer forward nor behind

    I look in hope or fear
    But grateful take the good I find

    The best of now and here

    I plough no more a desert land

    To harvest weed and tare
    The manna dropping from God

    Rebukes my painful care

    I break my pilgrim staff I lay

    Aside the toiling oar
    The angel sought so far away

    I welcome at my door

    The airs of spring may never play

    Among the ripening corn
    Nor freshness of the flowers of May

    Blow through the autumn morn

    Yet shall the blueeyed gentian look
    Through fringed lids to heaven

    And the pale aster in the brook
    Shall see its image given

    The woods shall wear their robes of praise

    The southwind softly sigh
    And sweet calm days in golden haze

    Melt down the amber sky

    Not less shall manly deed and word

    Rebuke an age of wrong
    The graven flowers that wreathe the sword

    Make not the blade less strong

    But smiting hands shall learn to heal

    To build as to destroy
    Nor less my heart for others feel

    That I the more enjoy

    All as God wills who wisely heeds

    To give or to withhold
    And knoweth more of all my needs

    Than all my prayers have told

    Enough that blessings undeserved
    Have marked my erring track

    That wlieresoeer my feet have swerved
    His chastening turned me back

    That more and more a Providence

    Of love is understood
    Making the springs of time and sense

    Sweet with eternal good

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    That death seeius but a covered way
    Which opens into light

    Wherein no blinded child can stray
    Beyond the Father

    That care and trial seem at last
    Through Memorys sunset aii

    Like mountainranges overpast
    In purple distance fair

    That all the jarring notes of life
    Seem blending in a psalm

    And all the angles of its strife
    Slow rounding into calm

    And so the shadows fall apart
    And so the westwinds play

    And all the windows of my heart
    I open to the day



    THE WAITING

    I WAIT and watch  before my eyes

    Methinks the night grows thin and
    gray

    I wait and watch the eastern skies

    To see the golden spears uprise
    Beneath the oriflamme of day



    Like one whose limbs are bound in trance
    I hear the daysounds swell and grow
    And see across the twilight glance
    Troop after troop in swift advance
    The shining ones with phuues of snow

    I know the errand of their feet

    I know what mighty work is theirs
    I can but lift up hands unmeet
    The threshinglloors of God to beat

    And speed them with unworthy prayers

    I will not dream in vain despair

    The steps of progress wait for me
    The puny leverage of a hair
    The planet
    A drop of dew the tided sea

    The loss if loss there be is mine

    And yet not mine if understood
    For one shall grasp and one resign
    One drink lifes rue and one its wine
    And God shall make the balance good

    Oh power to do  Oh baffled will

    Oh prayer and action  ye are one
    Who may not strive may yet fulfil
    The harder task of standing still

    And good but wished with God is done

    A WINTER IDYL



    TO THE MEMORY OF THE HOUSEHOLD IT DESCRIBES
    THIS POEM IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR



    The inmates of the family at the Whittier
    homestead who are referred to in the poem
    were ray father mother my brother and two
    sisters and my uncle and aunt both unmarried
    In addition there was the district school mas
    ter who boarded with us The
    halfwelcome guest  was Harriet Livermore
    daughter of Judge Livermore of New Hamp
    shire a young woman of fine natviral ability
    enthusiastic eccentric with slight control over
    her violent temper which sometimes made her
    religious profession doubtful She was equally
    ready to exhort in sclioolhouse prayermeetings
    and dance in a Washington hallroom while
    her father was a member of congress She
    early embraced the doctrine of the Second Ad



    vent and felt it her duty to proclaim the Lord
    speedy coming With this message she crossed
    the Atlantic and spent the greater part of a
    long life in travelling over Europe and Asia
    She lived some time with Lady Hester Stan
    hope a woman as fantastic and mentally
    strained as herself on the slope of Mt Lebanon
    but finally quarrelled with her in regard to two
    white liorses with red marks on their backs
    which suggested the idea of saddles on which
    her titled hostess expected to ride into Jerusa
    lem with the Lord A friend of mine found
    her when quite an old woman wandering in
    Syria with a tribe of Arabs who with the Ori
    ental notion that madness is inspiration ac
    cepted her as their projihetess and leader At

    the time referred to in SnowBound she was
    boarding at the Rocks Village about two miles
    from us

    In my boyhood in our lonely farmhouse
    we had scanty sources of information  few
    books and only a small weekly newspaper
    Our only annual was the Almanac Under
    such circumstancts storytelling
    sary resource in the long winter evenings
    My father when a young man had traversed
    the wilderness to Canada and could tell us of
    his adventures with Indians and wild beasts
    and of his sojourn in the French villages My
    uncle was ready with his record of hunting
    and fishing and it must be confessed with
    stories which he at least half believed of witch
    craft and apparitions My mother who was
    born in the Indianhaunted region of Somers
    worth New Hampshire between Dover and
    Portsmouth told us of the inroads of the sav
    ages and the narrow escape of her ancestors
    She described strange people who lived on the
    Piscataqua and Cocheco among whom was
    Bantam the sorcerer I have in my possession

    Seems nowhere to alight  the whited air
    Hides liills and woods the river and the heaven
    And veils the farmhouse at the gardens end

    Emerson The Snow Storm

    The sun that brief December day
    Rose cheerless over hills of gray
    And darkly circled gave at noon
    A sadder light than waning moon



    Slow tracing down the thickening sky

    Its mute and ominous prophecy

    A portent seeming less than threat

    It sank from sight before it set

    A chill no coat however stout

    Of homespun stuff could quite shut out

    A hard dull bitterness of cold

    That checked midvein the circling race

    Of lifeblood in the sharpened face

    The coming of the snowstorm told

    The wind blew east  we heard the roar

    Of Ocean on his wintry shore

    And felt the strong pulse throbbing there

    Beat with low rhythm our inland air

    Meanwhile we did our nightly chores
    Brought in the wood from out of doors
    Littered the stalls and from the mows
    Raked down the herd
    Heard the horse whinnying for his corn
    And sharply clashing horn on born
    Impatient down the stanchion rows
    The cattle shake their walnut bows
    While peering from his early perch
    Upon the scaffolds pole of birch
    The cock his crested helmet bent
    And down his querulous challenge sent

    Unwarmed by any sunset light

    The gray day darkened into night

    A night made hoary with the swarm

    And whii

    As zigzag wavering to and fro

    Crossed and recrossed the winged snow

    And ere the early bedtime came

    The white drift piled the windowframe

    And through the glass the clothesline posts

    Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts

    So all night long the storm roared on
    The morning broke without a sun
    In tiny spherule traced with lines
    Of Natures geometric signs
    In starry flake and pellicle
    All day the hoary meteor fell
    And when the second morning shone
    We looked upon a world unknovn
    On nothing we could call our own
    Aromid the glistening wonder bent
    The blue walls of the firmament
    No cloud above no earth below
    A universe of sky and snow
    The old familiar sights of ours
    Took marvellous shapes  strange domes
    and towers

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    Rose up where sty or corncrib stood

    Or gardenwall or belt of wood

    A smooth white mound the brush  pile

    showed
    A fenceless drift what once was road
    The bridlepost an old man sat
    With looseHung coat and high cocked hat
    The wellcurb had a Chinese roof
    And even the long sweep high aloof
    In its slant splendor seemed to tell
    Of Pisa

    A prompt decisive man no breath
    Our father wasted   Boys a path
    Well pleased for when did farmer boy
    Count such a summons less than joy
    Our buskins on our feet we drew
    With mittened hands and caps drawn low
    To guard our necks and ears from snow
    We cut the solid whiteness thiough
    And where the drift was deepest made
    A tunnel walled and overlaid
    With dazzling crystal  we had read
    Of rare Aladdins wondrous cave
    And to our own his name we gave
    With many a wish the luck were ours
    To test his lamp
    We reached the barn with merry din
    And roused the prisoned brutes within
    The old horse thrust his long head out
    And grave with wonder gazed about
    The cock his lusty greeting said
    And forth his speckled harem led
    The oxen lashed their tails and hooked
    And mild reproach of hunger looked
    The horned patriarch of the sheep
    Like Egypts Amun roused from sleep
    Shook his sage head with gesture mute
    And emphasized with stamp of foot

    All day the gusty northwind bore

    The loosening drift its breath before

    Low circling roimd its southern zone

    The sun through dazzling snowmist shone

    No churchbell lent its Christian tone

    To the savage air no social smoke

    Curled over woods of snowhung oak

    A solitude made more intense

    By drearyvoiced elements

    The shrieking of the mindless wind

    The moaning treeboughs swaying blind

    And on the glass the unmeaning beat

    Of ghostly fingertips of sleet

    Beyond the circle of our hearth

    No welcome sound of toil or mirth



    Unbound the spell and testified
    Of human life and thought outside
    We minded that the sharpest ear
    The buried brooklet could not hear
    The music of whose liquid lip
    Had been to us companionship
    And in our lonely life had grovra
    To have an almost himiau tone

    As night drew on and from the crest
    Of wooded knolls that ridged the west
    The sun a snowblown traveller sank
    From sight beneath the smothering bank
    We piled with care our nightly stack
    Of wood against the chimneyback
    The oaken log green huge and thick
    And on its top the stout backstick
    The knotty forestick laid apart
    And filled between with curious art
    The ragged brush  then hovering near
    We watched the first red blaze appear
    Heard the sharp crackle caught the gleam
    On whitewashed wall and sagging beam
    Until the old rudefurnished room
    Burst Howerlike into rosy bloom
    While radiant with a mimic flame
    Outside the sparkling drift became
    And through the bareboughed lilactree
    Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free
    The crane and pendent trammels showed
    The Turks
    While childish fancy prompt to tell
    The meaning of the miracle
    Whispered the old rhyme   Under the tree
    Whenjire outdoors burns merrily
    There the witches are making tea

    The moon above the eastern wood
    Shone at its full  the hillrange stood
    Transfigured in the silver flood
    Its blown snows flashing cold and keen
    Dead white save where some sharp ravine
    Took shadow or the sombre green
    Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black
    Against the whiteness at their back
    For such a world and such a night
    Most fitting that unwarming light
    er it fell
    To make the coldness visible

    Shut in from all the world without
    We sat the cleanwinged hearth about
    Content to let the northwind roar
    In baffled rage at pane and door
    While the red logs before us beat



    SNOWBOUND



    401



    The frostline back with tropic heat
    And ever when a louder blast
    Shook beam and rafter as it passed
    The merrier up its roaring draught
    The great throat of the chimney laughed
    The housedog on his paws outspread
    Laid to the fire his drowsy head
    The cat
    A couchant tigers seemed to fall
    And for the winter fireside meet
    Between the andirons
    The mug of cider sinnnered slow
    The apples sputtered in a row
    And close at hand the basket stood
    s wood

    What matter how the night behaved
    What matter how the northwind raved
    Blow high blow low not all its snow
    Could cpiench our hearth fire

    glow
    O Time and Change   with hair as gray
    As was my sires that winter day
    How strange it seems with so much gone
    Of life and love to still live on
    Ah brother  only 1 and thou
    Are left of all that circle now
    The dear home faces whereupon
    That fitful firelight paled and shone
    Henceforward listen as we will
    The voices of that hearth are still
    Look where we may the wide earth o
    Those lighted faces smile no more
    We tread the paths their feet have worn

    We sit beneath their orchard trees

    We hear like them the hum of bees
    And rustle of the bladed corn
    We turn the pages that they read

    er
    But in the sun they cast no shade
    No voice is heard no sign is made

    No step is on the conscious floor
    Yet Love will dream and Faith will

    trust
    Since He who knows our need is just
    That somehow somewhere meet we must
    Alas for him who never sees
    The stars shine through his cypresstrees
    Who hopeless lays his dead away
    Nor looks to see the breaking day
    Across the mournful marbles play
    Who hath not learned in hours of faith

    The truth to flesh and sense unknown
    That Life is ever lord of Death

    And Love can never lose its own



    We sjied the time with stories old
    Wrought puzzles out and riddles told
    Or stammered from our schoolbook lore
    The Chief of Gambias golden shore
    How often since wdien all the land
    Was clay in Slavery
    As if a farblown trumpet stirred
    The languorous sinsick air I heard
    Does not the voice of reason cry

    Claim the first right which Nature gave
    From the red scourge of bondage Jig

    Nor deign to live a burdened slave
    Our father rode again his ride
    On Memphremagogs wooded side
    Sat down again to moose and samp
    In trapper
    Lived oer the old idyllic ease
    Beneath St Francois
    Again for him the moonlight shone
    On Norman cap and bodiced zone
    Again he heard the violin play
    Which led the village dance away
    And mingled in its merry whirl
    The grandam and the laughing girl
    Or nearer home our steps he led
    Where Salisburys level marshes spread

    Milewide as flies the laden bee
    Where merry mowers hale and strong
    Swept scythe on scythe their swaths along

    The low green prairies of the sea
    We shared the fishing off Boars Head

    And round the rocky Isles of Shoals

    The hakebroil on the driftwood coals
    The chowder on the sandbeach made
    Dipped by the liungiy steaming hot
    With spoons of clamshell from the pot
    We heard the tales of witchcraft old
    And dream and sign and marvel told
    To sleepy listeners as they lay
    Stretched idly on the salted hay
    Adrift along the winding shores
    When favoring breezes deigned to blow
    The square sail of the gundelow
    And idle lay the useless oars

    Our mother while she turned her wheel
    Or run the newknit stockingheel
    Told how the Indian hordes came down
    At midnight on Cocheco town
    And how her own greatnncle bore
    His cruel scalpmark to fourscore
    Recalling in her fitting phrase
    So rich and picturesque and free
    The common nnrhymed poetry
    Of simple life and country ways

    The story of her early clays
    She made xis welcome to her home
    Old hearths grew wide to give us room
    We stole with her a frightened look
    At the gray wizard
    The fame whereof went far and wide
    Through all the simple country side
    We heard the hawks at twilight play
    The boathorn on Piscataqua
    The loons weird laughter far away
    We fished her little troutbrook knew
    What flowers in wood and meadow grew
    What sunny hillsides autumnbrown
    She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down
    Saw where in sheltered cove and bay
    The ducks
    And heard the wildgeese calling loud
    Beneath the gray November cloud

    Then haply with a look more grave

    And soberer tone some tale she gave

    From painful Sewels ancient tome

    Beloved in every Quaker home

    Of faith firewinged by martyrdom

    Or Chalkley

    Gentlest of skippers rare seasaint

    Who when the dreary calms prevailed

    And waterbutt and breadcask failed

    And cruel hungry eyes pursued

    His portly presence mad for food

    AVitli daik hints muttered under breath

    Of casting lots for life or death

    Offered if Heaven withheld supplies

    To be himself the sacrifice

    Then suddenly as if to save

    The good man from his living grave

    A ripple on the water grew

    A school of porpoise flashed in view

    Take eat he said

    These fishes in my stead are sent

    By Him who gave the tangled ram

    To spare the child of Abraham

    Our uncle innocent of books
    Was ricli in lore of fields and brooks
    The ancient teachers never dumb
    Of Nature
    In moons and tides and weather wise
    He read the clouds as prophecies
    And foul or fair could well divine
    By many an occult hint and sign
    Holding the cunningwarded keys
    To all the woodcraft mysteries
    Himself to Natures heart so near
    That all her voices in his ear



    Of beast or bird had meanings clear

    Like Apollonius of old

    Who knew the tales the sparrows told

    Or Hermes who interpreted

    What the sage cranes of Nilus said

    Content to live where life began

    A simple gviileless childlike man

    Strong only on his native grounds

    The little world of sights and sounds

    Whose girdle was the parish bounds

    Whereof his fondly partial pride

    The common features magnified

    As Surrey hills to mountains grew

    In White of Selborne

    He told how teal and loon he shot

    And how the eagles eggs he got

    The feats on pond and river done

    The prodigies of rod and gun

    Till warming with the tales lie told

    Forgotten was the outside cold

    The bitter wind unheeded blew

    From ripening corn the pigeons flew

    The partridge drummed i

    mink
    Went fishing down the riverbrink
    In fields with bean or clover gay
    The woodchuck like a hermit gray

    Peered from the doorway of his cell
    s trade
    And tier by tier his mud walls laid
    And from tlie shagbark overhead

    The grizzled squirrel dropped his shell

    Next the dear aunt whose smile of cheer
    And voice in dreams I see and hear
    The sweetest woman ever Fate
    Perverse denied a household mate
    Who lonely homeless not the less
    Found peace in love
    And welcome wheresoeer she went
    A calm and gracious element
    Whose presence seemed the sweet income
    And womanly atmosphere of home
    Called up her girlhood memories
    The Imskings and the applebees
    The sleighrides and the summer sails
    Weaving througli all the poor details
    And homespun warp of circumstance
    A golden woofthread of I
    For well she kept her genial mood
    And simple faith of maidenhood
    Before her still a cloudland lay
    The mirage loomed across her way
    The morning dew that dries so soon
    With others glistened at her noon

    Through years of toil and soil and care

    From glossy tress to thin gray hair

    All unprofaned she held apart

    The virgin fancies of the heart

    Be shame to him of woman born

    Who hath for such but thought of scorn

    Tliere too our elder sister plied
    Her evening task the stand beside
    A full rich nature free to trust
    Truthful and almost sternly just
    Impulsive earnest prompt to act
    And make her generous thought a fact
    Keeping with many a light disguise
    The secret of selfsacrifice

    heart soretried  thou hast the best
    That Heaven itself could give thee  rest
    Rest from all bitter thoughts and things

    How many a poor ones blessing went
    With thee beneath the low green tent
    Whose curtain never outward swings

    As one who held herself a part
    Of all she saw and let her heart

    Against the household bosom lean
    Upon the motleybraided mat
    Our youngest and our dearest sat
    Lifting her large sweet asking eyes

    Now bathed in the unfading green
    And holy peace of Paradise
    Oh looking from some heavenly hill

    Or from the shade of saintly palms

    Or silver reach of river calms
    Do those large eyes behold me still
    With me one little year ago
    The chill weight of the winter snow

    For months upon her grave has lain
    And now when summer southwinds blow

    And brier and harebell bloom again

    1 tread the pleasant paths we trod
    I see the violetsprinkled sod
    Whereon she leaned too frail and weak
    The hillside flowers she loved to seek
    Yet following me where
    s content
    Tlie birds are glad  the brierrose fills
    The air with sweetness  all the hills
    Stretch green to June
    But still I wait with ear and eye

    For something gone which should be nigh
    A loss in all familiar things
    In flower that blooms and bird that sings
    And yet dear heart  remembering thee

    Am I not richer than of old
    Safe in thy immortality



    What change can reach the wealth I
    hold

    What cliance can mar the pearl and gold
    Thy love hath left in trust with me
    And while in lifes late afternoon

    Where cool and long the shadows grow
    I walk to meet the night that soon

    Shall shape and shadow overflow
    I cannot feel that thou art far
    Since near at need the angels are
    And when the sunset gates unbar

    Shall I not see thee waiting stand
    And white against the evening star

    The welcome of thy beckoning hand

    Brisk wielder of the birch and rule
    The master of the district school
    Held at the fire his favored place
    Its warm glow lit a laughing face
    Freshhued and fair where scarce appeared
    The uncertain projjhecy of beard
    He teased the mittenblinded cat
    Played crosspins on my uncle
    Sang songs and told us what befalls
    In classic Dartmouths college halls
    Born the wild Northern hills among
    From whence his yeoman father wrung
    By patient toil subsistence scant
    Not competence and j
    He early gained the power to pay
    His cheerful selfreliant way
    s gown
    To peddle wares from town to town
    Or through the long vacation
    In lonely lowland districts teach
    Where all the droll experience found
    At stranger hearths in boarding round
    The moonlit skaters keen delight
    The sleighdrive through the frosty night
    The rusticparty with its rough
    Accompaniment of blindman
    And whirlingplate and forfeits paid
    His winter task a pastime made
    Happy the snowlocked homes wherein
    He tuned his merry violin
    Or played the athlete in the barn
    Or held the good dames windingyarn
    Or mirthprovoking versions told
    Of classic legends rare and old
    Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome
    Had all the commonplace of home
    And little seemed at best the odds
    Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods
    Where Pindusborn Arachtlms took
    The guise of any gristmill brook

    Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light

    Unmarked by time and yet not young

    The honeyed music of her tongue

    And words of meekness scarcely told

    A nature passionate and bold

    Strong selfconcentred spvirning guide

    Its milder features dwarfed beside

    Her unbent wills majestic pride

    She sat among us at the best

    A not unfeared halfwelcome guest

    Rebuking with her cultured phrase

    Our homeliness of words and ways

    A certain pardlike treacherous grace

    Swayed the lithe limbs and diopped the

    lash
    Lent the white teeth their dazzling flash
    And under low brows black with night
    Rayed out at times a dangerous light
    The sharp heatlightnings of her face



    Presaging ill to him whom Fate
    Condemned to share her love or hate
    A woman tropical intense
    In thought and act in soul and sense
    She blended in a like degree
    The vixen and the devotee
    Revealing with each freak or feint
    The temper of Petruchio
    The raptures of Sienas saint
    Her tapering hand and rounded wrist
    Had facile power to form a fisl
    The warm dark languish of her eyes
    Was never safe from wrath
    Brows saintly calm and lijjs devout
    Knew every change of scowl and pout
    And the sweet voice had notes more high
    And shrill for social battlecry

    Since then what old cathedral town
    Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown
    What conventgate has held its lock
    Against the challenge of her knock
    Through Smyrnas plaguehushed thorough
    fares
    Up seaset Malta
    Gray olive slo2es of hills that hem

    Thy tombs and shrines Jerusalem
    Or startling on her desert throne
    The crazy Queen of Lebanon
    With claims fantastic as her own
    Her tireless feet have held their way
    And still unrestful bowed and gray
    She watches under Eastern skies

    With hope each day renewed and fresh
    The Lords quick coming in the flesh
    Whereof she dreams and prophesies

    Whereer her troubled path maj be
    The Lord

    The outward wayward life we see

    not know

    Nor is it given us to discern

    What threads the fatal sisters spun
    Through what ancestral years lias run

    The sorrow with the woman born

    What forged her cruel chain of moods

    What set her feet in solitudes

    And held the love within her mute

    What mingled madness in the blood
    A lifelong discord and annoy
    Water of tears with oil of joy

    And hid within the folded bud
    Perversities of flower and fruit

    It is not ours to separate

    To show what metes and bounds shoukl

    stand
    Upon the soul
    And between choice and Providence
    Divide the circle of events
    But He who knows our frame is just
    Merciful and compassionate
    And full of sweet assurances
    And hope for all the language is
    That He reniembereth we are dust

    At last the great logs crumbling low
    Sent out a dull and duller glow
    The bullseye watch that huug in view
    Ticking its weary circuit through
    Pointed with mutely warning sign
    Its black hand to the hour of nine
    That sign the pleasant circle broke
    My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke
    Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray
    And laid it tenderly away
    Then roused himself to safely cover
    The dull red brands with ashes over
    And while with care our mother laid
    The work aside her steps she stayed
    One moment seeking to express
    Her grateful sense of happiness
    For food and shelter warmth and health
    And love
    With simple wislies not the weak
    Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek
    But such as warm the generous heart
    Oerprompt to do with Heaven its part
    That none might lack that bitter night
    For bread and clothing warmth and light

    Within our beds awhile we heard
    The wind that round the gables roared
    With now and then a ruder shock
    Which made our very bedsteads rock
    We heard the loosened clapboards tost
    The boardnails snapping in the frost
    And on us through the luiplastered wall
    Felt the light sifted snowflakes fall
    But sleep stole on as sleep will do
    When hearts are light and life is new
    Faint and more faint the murmurs grew
    Till in the summerland of diearas
    They softened to the sound of streams
    Low stir of leaves and dip of oars
    And lapsing waves on quiet shores

    Next morn we wakened witli the shout
    Of merry voices high and clear



    And saw the teamsters drawing near
    To break tlie drifted highways out
    Down the long hillside treading slow
    We saw the halfburied oxen go
    Shaking the snow from heads uptost
    Their straining nostrils white with frost
    Before our door the straggling train
    Drew up an added team to gain
    The elders threslied tlieir hands acold
    Passed witli the cidermug their jokes
    From lip to lip  the younger folks
    Down the loose snow  banks wrestling

    rolled
    Then toiled again the cavalcade

    O
    And woodland patlis that wound between
    Low drooping pinebouglis winterweighed
    From every barn a team afoot
    At every house a new recruit
    Where drawn by Natures subtlest law
    Haply the watchful young men saw
    Sweet doorway pictures of the curls
    And curious eyes of merry girls
    Lifting their hands in mock defence
    Against the snowball
    And reading in each missive tost
    The charm with Etlen never lost

    sound

    And following where the teamsters led
    The wise old Doctor went his round
    Just pausing at our door to say
    In the brief autocratic way
    Of one who prompt at Duty
    Was free to urge her claim on all

    That some poor neighbor sick abed
    At night our mothers aid would need
    For one in generous thought and deed

    What mattered in the sufferer

    The Quaker matrons inward light
    Tlie Doctors mail of Calvins creed
    All hearts confess the saints elect

    Who twain in faith in love agree
    And melt not in an acid sect

    The Christian pearl of charity

    So days went on  a week had passed
    Since the great world was heard from

    last
    The Almanac we studied o
    Read and reread our little store
    Of books and pamphlets scarce a score
    One harmless novel mostly hid

    And poetry or good or bad

    A single book was all we had

    Where Ellwoods meek drabskirted Muse

    A stranger to the heathen Nine

    Sang with a somewhat nasal whine
    The wars of David and the Jews
    At last the floundering carrier bore
    The callage paper to our door
    Lo  broadening outward as we read
    To warmer zones the horizon spread
    In panoramic length unrolled
    We saw the marvels that it told
    Before us passed the painted Creeks

    And daft McGregor on his raids

    In Costa Rica
    And up Taygetos winding slow
    Rode Ypsilantis Mainote Greeks
    A Turk
    Welcome to vis its weekold news
    Its corner for the rustic Muse

    Its monthly gauge of snow and rain
    Its record mingling in a breath
    The wedding bell and dirge of death
    Jest anecdote and lovelorn tale
    The latest culprit sent to jail
    Its hue and cry of stolen and lost
    Its vendue sales and goods at cost

    And traffic calling loud for gain
    We felt the stir of hall and street
    The pulse of life that round us beat
    The chill embargo of the snow
    Was melted in the genial glow
    Wide swung again our icelocked door
    And all the world was ours once more

    Clasp Angel of the backward look

    And folded wings of ashen gray

    And voice of echoes far away
    The brazen covers of thy book
    The weird palimpsest old and vast
    Wherein thou hidst the spectral past
    Where closely mingling pale and glow
    The characters of joy and woe
    The monographs of outlived years
    Or smileillumed or dim with tears

    Green hills of life that slope to death
    And haunts of home whose vistaed trees
    Shade off to mournful cypresses

    With the white amaranths underneath
    Even while I look I can but heed

    The restless sands
    Importunate hours that hours succeed
    Each clamorous with its own sharp need

    And duty keeping pace with all
    Shut down and clasp the heavy lids



    I hear again the voice that bids
    The dreamer leave his dream midway
    For larger hopes and graver fears
    Life greatens in these later years
    The centurys aloe flowers today

    Yet haply in some lull of life

    Some Truce of God which breaks its strife

    The worldling

    Dreaming in throngful city ways
    Of winter joys his boyhood knew
    And dear and early friends  the few
    Who yet remain  shall pause to view

    These Flemish pictures of old days
    Sit with me by the homestead hearth
    And stretch the hands of memory forth

    s blaze
    And thanks untraced to lips unknown
    Shall greet me like the odors blown
    From unseen meadows newly mown
    Or lilies floating in some pond
    Woodfringed the wayside gaze beyond
    The traveller owns the grateful sense
    Of sweetness near he knows not whence
    And pausing takes with forehead bare
    The benediction of the air



    MY TRIUMPH

    The autumntime has come
    On woods that dream of bloom
    And over purpling vines
    The low sun fainter shines

    The asterflower is failing
    The hazel
    Yet overhead more near
    The eternal stars appear

    And present gratitude
    Insures the futures good
    And for the things I see
    I trust the things to be

    That in the paths untrod
    And the long days of God
    My feet shall still be led
    My heart be comforted

    O living friends who love me

    dear ones gone above me

    Hide it from idle praises

    Save it from evil phrases

    Why when dear lips that spake it

    Are dumb should strangers wake it

    Let the thick curtain fall
    I better know than all
    How little I have gained
    How vast the unattaiued

    Not by the page wordpahited
    Let life be banned or sainted
    Deeper than written scroll
    The colors of the soul

    Sweeter than any sung

    My songs that found no tongue

    Nobler than any fact

    My wish that failed of act

    Others shall sing the song
    Others sliall right the wrong
    Finish what 1 begin
    And all I fail of win

    What matter I or they
    Mine or another
    So the right word be said
    And life the sweeter made

    Hail to the coming singers
    Hail to the brave lightbringers
    Forward I reach and share
    All that they sing and dare

    er me
    A glory shines before me
    Of what mankind shall be
    Pure generous brave and free

    A dream of man and woman
    Diviner but still human
    Solving the riddle old
    Shaping the Age of Gold

    The love of God and neighbor
    An equalhanded labor
    The richer life where beauty
    Walks hand in hand with duty

    Ring bells in unreared steeples
    The joy of unborn peoples
    Sound trumpets far off blown
    Your triumph is my own



    Parcel and part of all
    I keep the festival
    Forereach the good to be
    And share the victory

    I feel the earth move sunward
    I join the great march onward
    And take by faith while living
    My freehold of thanksgiving

    IN SCHOOLDAYS

    Still sits the schoolhouse by the road

    A ragged beggar sleeping
    Around it still the sumachs grow

    And blackberryvines are creeping

    Within the master
    Deep scarred by raps official

    The warping floor the battered seats
    The jackknifes carved initial

    The charcoal frescos on its wall

    Its door
    The feet that creeping slow to school

    Went storming out to playing

    Long years ago a winter sun

    Shone over it at setting
    Lit up its western windowpanes

    And low eaves icy fretting

    It touched the tangled golden curls
    And brown eyes full of grieving

    Of one who still her steps delayed
    When all the school were leaving

    For near her stood the little boy

    Her childish favor singled
    His cap pulled low upon a face

    Where pride and shame were mingled

    Pushing with restless feet the snow
    To right and left he lingered

    As restlessly her tiny hands

    The bluechecked apron fingered

    He saw her lift her eyes  he felt
    The soft hand

    And heard the tremble of her voice
    As if a faidt confessing

    I
    I hate to go above you

    Because  the brown ejes lover fell
    Because you see I love you

    Still memory to a grayhaired man
    That sweet childface is showing

    Dear girl  the grasses on her grave
    Have forty years been growing

    s hard school
    How few who pass above him

    Lament their triumph and his loss
    Like her  because they love him



    MY BIRTHDAY

    Beneath the moonlight and the snow

    Lies dead my latest year
    The winter winds are wailing low

    Its dirges in my ear

    I grieve not with the moaning wind

    As if a loss befell
    Before me even as behind

    God is and all is well

    His light shines on me from above
    His low voice speaks within

    The patience of immortal love
    Out wearying mortal sin

    Not mindless of the growing years

    Of care and loss and 2ain
    My ejes are wet with thankful tears

    For blessings which remain

    If dim the gold of life has grown

    I will not count it dross
    Nor turn from treasures still my own

    To sigh for lack and loss

    The years no charm from Nature take

    As sweet lier voices call
    As beautiful her mornings break

    As fair her evenings fall

    Love watches o
    Kind voices speak my name

    And lips that find it hard to praise
    Are slow at least to blame

    How softly ebb the tides of will

    How fields once lost or won
    Now lie behind me green and still

    Beneath a level sun



    How hushed the hiss of party hate

    The clamor of the throng
    How old harsh voices of debate

    Flow into rhythmic song

    Methinks the spirits temper grows

    Too soft in tins still air
    Somewhat the restful heart foregoes

    Of needed watch and prayer

    The bark by tempest vainly tossed

    May founder in the calm
    And he who braved the polar frost

    Faint by the isles of balm

    Better than selfindulgent years

    The outflung heart of youth
    Than pleasant songs in idle ears

    The tumult of the truth

    Rest for the weary hands is good
    And love for hearts that pine

    But let the manly habitude
    Of upright souls be mine

    Let winds that blow from heaven refresh

    Dear Lord the languid air
    And let the weakness of the flesh

    Thy strength of spirit share

    And if the eye must fail of light

    The ear forget to hear
    Make clearer still the spirit

    More fine the inward ear

    Be near me in mine hours of need

    To soothe or cheer or warn
    And down these slopes of sunset lead

    As up the hills of morn



    RED RIDINGHOOD

    On the wide lawn the snow lay deep
    Ridged oer with many a drifted heap
    The wind that through the pinetrees sung
    The naked elmboughs tossed and swung
    While through the window frostystan
    Against the sunset purple barred
    We saw the sombre crow flap by
    The hawks gray fleck along the sky
    The crested bluejay flitting swift
    The squirrel poising on the drift
    Erect alert his broad gray tail
    Set to the north wind like a sail

    It came to pass our little lass

    AVith flattened face against the glass

    And eyes in which the tender dew

    Of pity shone stood gazing through

    The narrow space her rosy lips

    Had melted from the frost

    Oh see she cried  the poor bluejays

    What is it that the black crow says

    The squirrel lifts his little legs

    Because he has no hands and begs

    He s asking for my nuts I know

    May I not feed them on the snow

    Half lost within her boots her head
    Warmsheltered in her hood of red
    Her plaid skirt close about her drawn
    She floundered down the wintry lawn
    Now struggling through the misty veil
    Blown round her by the shrieking gale
    Now sinking in a drift so low
    Her scarlet hood could scarcely show
    Its dash of color on the snow

    She dropped for bird and beast forlorn

    Her little store of nuts and corn

    And thus her timid guests bespoke

    Come squirrel from your hollow oak

    Come black old crow  come poor blue

    Before your supper

    Dont be afraid we all are good

    And I m mammas Red RidingHood

    O Thou whose care is over all
    Who heedest even the sparrows fall
    Keep in the little maidens breast
    The pity which is now its guest
    Let not her cultured years make less
    The childhood charm of tenderness
    But let her feel as well as know
    Nor harder with her polish grow
    Unmoved by sentimental grief
    That wails along some printed leaf
    But prompt with kindly word and deed
    To own the claims of all who need
    Let the grown womans self make good
    The promise of Red RidingHood



    RESPONSE

    On the occasion of my seventieth birthday in
    1877 I was the recipient of many tokens of
    esteem The publishers of the Atlantic Monlhh
    gave a dinner in ray name and the editor of



    The Literary TForW gatliered in his paper many
    affectionate messages from my associates in
    literature and the cause of Imman progress
    The lines which follow were written in acknow
    ledgment

    Beside that milestone where the level sun
    Nigh unto setting sheds his last low

    rays
    On word and work irrevocably done
    Lifes blending threads of good and ill out
    spun
    I hear O friends  your words of cheer

    and praise
    Half doubtful if myself or otherwise
    Like him who in the old Arabian joke
    A beggar slept and crowned Caliph

    woke
    Thanks not the less With not unglad

    surprise
    I see my lifework throngh your partial

    eyes
    Assured in giving to my home taught

    songs
    A higher value than of right belongs
    You do but read between the written lines
    The tiner grace of unfulfilled designs

    Poor and inadequate the shadowplay
    Of gain and loss of waking and of

    Against lifes solemn background needs

    At this late hour Yet not unthankfully
    I call to mind the fountains by the way
    The breath of flowers the birdsong on the

    spray
    Dear friends sweet human loves the joy of

    giving
    And of receiving the great boon of liv

    In grand historic years when Liberty
    Had need of word and work quick sympa
    thies
    For all who fail and suffer songs relief
    Natures uncloying loveliness  and cliief

    Of an Eternal Good vliich overlies
    The sorrow of the world Love which out

    VOYAGE OF THE JETTIE

    The picturesquely situated Wayside Inn at
    West Ossipee N H is now in ashes and to
    its former guests these somewhat careless
    rhymes may he a not unwelcome reminder of
    pleasant summers and autumns on the banks
    of the Beareanap and Chocorua To the author
    himself they have a special interest from the
    fact that they were wiitten or improvised
    under the eye and for the amusement of a be
    loved invalid friend whose last earthly sunsets
    faded from the mountain ranges of Ossipee
    and Sandwich

    A SHALLOW stream from fountains
    Deep in the Sandwich mountains

    Ran lakeward Bearcamp River
    And between its floodtorn shores
    Sped by sail or urged by oars

    No keel had vexed it ever

    Alone the dead trees yielding
    To the dull axe Time is wielding

    The shy mink and the otter
    And golden leaves and red
    By countless autumns shed

    Had floated down its water

    From the gray rocks of Cape Ann
    Came a skilled seafaring man

    With his dory to the right place
    Over hill and plain he brought her
    Where the boatless Bearcamp water

    Comes winding down from WhiteFace

    Quoth the skijjper   Ere she floats forth
    I m sure my pretty boat s worth

    At least a name as pretty
    On her painted side he wrote it
    And the flag tliat oer her floated

    Bore aloft the name of Jettie

    On a radiant morn of summer
    Elder guest and latest comer

    Saw her wed the Bearcamp water
    Heard the name the skipper gave her



    And the answer to the favor

    From the Bay States graceful daughter

    Then a singer richly gifted
    Her charmed voice uplifted

    And the woodthrush and songsparrow
    Listened dumb with envious pain
    To the clear and sweet refrain

    Whose notes they could not borrow

    Then the skipper plied his oar
    And from oft the shelving shore

    Glided out the strange explorer
    Floating on she knew not whither
    The tawny sands beneatli her

    The great hills watching oer her

    On where the stream flows quiet
    As the meadows margins by it

    Or widens out to borrow a
    New life from that wild water
    The mountain giants daughter

    The pinebesung Chocorua

    Or mid the tangling cumber
    And pack of mountain lumber

    That spring floods downward force
    Over sunken snag and bar
    Where the grating shallows are

    The good boat held her course

    Under the pinedark highlands
    Around the vinehung islands

    She ploughed her crooked furrow
    And her rippling and her lurches
    Scared the river eels and perches

    And the muskrat in his burrow

    Every sober clam below her
    Every sage and grave pearlgrower

    Shut his ilisty valves the tighter
    Crow called to crow complaining
    And old tortoises sat craning

    Their leathern necks to sight her

    So to where the still lake glasses
    The misty mountain masses

    Rising dim and distant northward
    And with faintdrawn shadow pictures
    Low shores and dead pine spectres

    Blends the skyward and the earthward

    On she glided overladen
    Witli merry man and maiden

    Sending back their solig and laughter

    While perchauce a phantom crew
    In a ghostly birch canoe

    Paddled dumb and swiftly after

    And the bear on Ossipee
    Climbed the topmost crag to see

    The strange thing drifting under
    And through the haze of August
    Passaconaway and Paugus

    Looked down in sleepy wonder

    All the pines that oer her hung
    In mimic seatones sung

    The song familiar to her
    And the maples leaned to screen her
    And the meadowgrass seemed greener

    And the breeze more soft to woo her

    The lone stream mysteryhaunted
    To her tlie freedom granted

    To scan its every feature
    Till new and old were blended
    And round them both extended

    The loving arms of Nature

    Of these hills the little vessel
    Henceforth is part and parcel

    And on Bearcamp shall her log
    Be kept as if by Georges
    Or Grand Menan the surges

    Tossed her skipper through the fog

    And I who half in sadness
    Recall the morning gladness

    Of life at evening time
    By chance onlooking idly
    Apart from all so widely

    Have set her voyage to rhyme

    Dies now the gay persistence
    Of song and laugh in distance

    Alone with me remaining
    The stream the quiet meadow
    The hills in shine and shadow

    The sombre pines complaining

    And musing here I dream
    Of voyagers on a stream

    From whence is no returning
    Under sealed orders going
    Looking forward little knowing

    Looking back with idle yearning

    And I pray that every venture
    The port of peace may enter



    That safe from snag and fall
    And sirenhaunted islet
    And rock the Unseen Pilot

    May guide us one and all

    MY TRUST

    A PICTURE memory brings to me
    I look across the years and see
    Myself beside my mothers knee

    I feel her gentle hand restrain

    My selfish moods and know again

    A childs blind sense of wrong and pain

    But wiser now a man gray grown
    My childhoods needs are better known
    My mothers chastening love I own

    Gray grown bnt in our Fathers sight
    A child still groping for the light
    To read His works and ways aright

    I wait in His good time to see
    That as my mother dealt with me
    So with His children dealeth He

    I bow myself beneath His hand
    That pain itself was wisely planned
    I feel and partly understand

    The joy that comes in sorrows guise
    The sweet pains of selfsacrifice
    I would not have them otherwise

    And what were life and death if sin
    Knew not the dread rebuke within
    The pang of merciful discipline

    Not with thy proud despair of old
    Crowned stoic of Romes noblest mould
    Pleasure and pain alike I hold

    I suffer vith no vain pretence
    Of triumph over flesh and sense
    Yet trust the grievous providence

    How dark soeer it seems may tend
    By ways I cannot comprehend
    To some unguessed benignant end

    That every loss and lapse may gain
    The clearaired heights by steps of pain
    And never cross is borne in vain

    A NAME

    Addressed to my grandnephew Greenleaf
    Whittier Piekard Jonathan Greenleaf in A
    Genealogy of the Greenleaf Family says briefly
    From all that can be gathered it is believed
    that the ancestors of the Greenleaf family Avere
    Huguenots who left France on account of their
    religious jrinciples some time in the course of
    the sixteenth century and settled in England
    The name was probably translated from the
    French Feuillevert

    The name the Gallic exile bore
    St Malo  from thy ancient mart

    Became upon our Western shore
    Greenleaf for Feuillevert

    A name to hear in soft accord
    Of leaves by light winds overrun

    Or read upon the greening sward
    Of May in shade and sun

    The name my infant ear first heard
    Breathed softly with a mother

    His mothers own no tenderer word
    My father spake than this

    No child have I to bear it on

    Be thou its keeper  let it take
    From gifts well used and duty done

    New beauty for thy sake

    The fair ideals that outran

    My halting footsteps seek and find
    The flawless symmetry of man

    The poise of heart and mind

    Stand firmly where I felt the sway
    Of every wing that fancy flew

    See clearly where I groped my way
    Nor real from seeming knew

    And wisely choose and bravely hold
    Thy faith unswerved by cross or crown

    Like the stout Huguenot of old
    Whose name to thee comes down

    As Marot

    Of that lone exile haply mine
    May in lifes heavy hours impart

    Some strength and hope to thine

    Yet when did Age transfer to Youth
    The hardgained lessons of its day



    Each lip must learn the taste of truth
    Each foot must feel its way

    We cannot hold the hands of choice
    That touch or shun life

    The whisper of the inward voice
    Is more than homilies

    Dear boy  for whom the flowers are born
    Stars shine and happy songbirds sing

    What can my evening give to morn
    My winter to thy spring

    A life not void of pure intent

    With small desert of praise or blame

    The love I felt the good I meant
    I leave thee with my name

    Missive and other Poems Entitled there The
    Prelude

    I SPREAD a scanty board too late
    The oldtime guests for whom I wait

    Come few and slow methinks today
    Ah  who could hear my messages
    Across the dim unsounded seas

    On which so many have sailed away

    Come then old friends who linger yet
    And let us meet as we have met

    Once more beneath this low sunshine
    And grateful for the good we
    The riddles solved the ills outgrown

    Shake hands upon the border line

    The favor asked too oft before
    From your indulgent ears once more

    I crave and if belated lays
    To slower feebler measures move
    The silent sympathy of love

    To me is dearer now than praise

    And ye O younger friends for whom
    My hearth and heart keep open room

    Come smiling through the shadows long
    Be with me while the sun goes down
    And with your cheerful voices drown

    The minor of my evensong

    For equal through the day and night
    The wise Eternal oversight

    And love and power and righteous will

    Through mortal lapse and dulness


    I WRITE my name as one


    What lacks the Eternal Fulness


    On sands by waves oerrun


    If still our weakness can

    To all who dumbly sufiered


    Wash on waves of time


    His tongue and pen he offered


    Melt noons the frosty rime


    His life was not his own


    Welcome the shadow vast


    Nor lived for self alone


    The silence that shall last






    Hater of din and riot


    When I and all who know

    Will the lost memory be

    Haunt an old mans memory still

    Its spectre lingers round


    With a boy


    Haply my spent life will


    Good old Abram Morrison


    Leave some faint echo still

    A whisper giving breath


    Ground and rumbled by Po Hill


    Of praise or blame to death


    And the old red schoolhouse stood


    Soothing or saddening such


    Midway in the Powows Hood


    As loved the living much


    Here dwelt Abram Moriison

    POEMS SUBJECTIVE AND REMINISCENT



    Foremost of his countrymen

    Hither came Friend Morrison


    Looks across its stormy bay

    Once the home of Morrisons


    Yankee born of alien blood
    Kin of his had well withstood
    Pope and King with pike and ball
    Under Derrys league red wall
    As became the Morrisons


    First was he to sing the praise
    Of the Powows winding ways
    And our straggling village took
    City grandeur to the look
    Of its poet Morrison


    Wandering down from Nutfield woods
    With his household and his goods
    Never was it clearly told
    How within our quiet fold
    Came to be a Morrison


    All his words have perished Shame
    On the saddlebags of Fame
    That they bring not to our time
    One poor couplet of the rhyme
    Made by Abram Morrison


    Once a soldier blame him not
    That the Quaker he forgot
    When to think of battles won
    And the redcoats on the run

    Laughed aloud Friend Morrison


    When on calm and fair First Days
    Rattled down our onehorse chaise
    Through the blossomed appleboughs
    To the old brown meetinghouse
    There was Abram Morrison


    From gray Lewis over sea
    Bore his sires their family tree
    On the rugged boughs of it
    Grafting Irish mirth and wit

    And the brogue of Morrison


    Underneath his hats broad brim
    Peered the queer old face of him
    And with Irish jauutiness
    Swung the coattails of the dress
    Worn by Abram Morrison


    Half a genius quick to plan
    Blundering like an Irishman
    But with canny shrewdness lent
    By his faroff Scotch descent
    Such was Abram Morrison


    Still in memory on his feet
    Leaning oer the elders seat
    Mingling with a solemn drone
    Celtic accents all his own
    Rises Abram Morrison


    Back and forth to daily meals
    Rode his cherished pig on wheels
    And to all who came to see
    Aisier for the pig an

    Sure it is said Morrison


    Dont he s pleading don
    Dear young friends to sight and show
    Dont run after elephants
    Learned pigs and presidents

    And the likes


    Simplehearted boy oergrown
    AVitli a humor quite his own
    Of our soberstepping ways
    Speech and look and cautious phrase
    Slow to learn was Morrison


    On his wellworn theme intent
    Simple childlike innocent
    Heaven forgive the halfchecked smile
    Of our careless boyhood while

    Listening to Friend Morrison


    Much we loved his stories told
    Of a country strange and old
    Where the fairies danced till dawn
    And the goblin Leprecaun

    Looked we thought like Morrison


    We have learned in latter days
    Truth may speak in simplest phrase
    That the man is not the less
    For quaint ways and homespun dress
    Thanks to Abram Morrison


    Or wild tales of feud and fight
    Witch and troll and second sight
    Whispered still where Stornoway


    Not to pander nor to please
    Come the needed homilies
    With no lofty argument



    A LEGACY



    415



    Is tlie fitting message sent

    Through such lips as Morrisons

    Dead and gone  But while its track
    Powow keeps to Merrimac
    While Po Hill is still on guard
    Looking land and ocean ward
    They shall tell of Morrison

    After half a centurys lapse
    We are wiser now perhaps
    But we miss our streets amid
    Something which the past has hid
    Lost with Abram Morrison

    Gone forever with the queer
    Characters of that old year
    Now the many are as one
    Broken is the mould that run
    Men like Abram Morrison



    A LEGACY

    Friend of my many years
    When the great silence falls at last on me



    Let me not leave to pain and sadden thee
    A memory of tears

    But pleasant thouglits alone
    Of one who was thy friendships honored

    guest
    And drank the wine of consolation pressed

    From sorrows of thy own

    I leave with thee a sense
    Of hands upheld and trials rendered less
    The unselfish joy which is to helpfulness

    Its own great iecompense

    The knowledge that from thine
    As from the garments of the Master

    stole
    Calnmess and strength the virtue which
    makes whole
    And heals without a sign

    Yea more the assurance strong
    That love which fails of perfect utterance

    here
    Lives on to fill the heavenly atmosphere

    With its immortal song



    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM

    Where Time the measure of his hours
    By changeful bud aud blossom keeps

    Aud like a young bride crowned with
    flowers
    Fair Shiraz in her garden sleeps

    Where to her poets turban stone

    The Spring her gift of flowers imparts

    Less sweet than those his thoughts have
    sown
    In the warm soil of Persian hearts

    There sat the stranger where the shade
    Of scatteied datetrees thinly lay

    While in the hot clear heaven delayed
    The long and still and weary day

    Strange trees and fruits above him hung
    Strange odors filled the sultry air

    Strange birds upon the branches swung
    Strange insect voices murunued there

    And strange bright blossoms shone around
    Turned sunward from the shadowy bow
    ers

    As if the Ghebers soul had found
    A fitting home in Irans flowers

    Whateer he saw whateer he heard
    Awakened feelings new and sad

    No Christian garb nor Christian word
    Nor church with Sabbath  bell chimes
    glad

    But Moslem graves with turban stones
    And mosquespires gleaming white in
    view

    And graybeard Mollahs in low tones
    Chanting their Koran service through

    The flowers which smiled on either hand
    Like tempting fiends were such as they

    Which once oer all that Eastern land
    As gifts on demon altars lay



    As if the burning eye of Baal

    The servant of his Conqueror knew

    From skies which knew no cloudy veil
    The Suns hot glances smote him through

    All me
    The hope which led my footsteps on

    And light from heaven around them shed
    O

    Where are the harvest fields all white
    For Truth to thrust her sickle in

    Where flock the souls like doves in flight
    From the dark hidingplace of sin

    er all
    The burden of a hateful spell

    The very flowers around recall
    The hoary magi

    And what am I oer such a land
    The banner of the Cross to bear

    Dear Lord ujhold me with Thy hand
    Thy strength with human weakness
    share

    He ceased  for at his very feet
    In mild rebuke a floweret smiled

    How thrilled his sinking heart to greet
    The Starflower of the Viigins child

    Sown by some wandering Frank it drew
    Its life from alien air and earth

    And told to Paynim sun and dew
    The story of the Saviours birth

    From scorching beams in kindly mood
    The Persian plants its beauty screened

    And on its pagan sisterhood

    In love the Christian floweret leaned

    With tears of joy the wanderer felt
    The darkness of his long despair

    Before tliat hallowed symbol melt

    Which Gods dear love had nurtured
    there

    417



    From I7atures face that simple flower
    The lilies of sin and sadness swept

    And Magiaii pile and Paynim bower
    In peace like that of Eden slept

    Each Moslem tomb and cypress old
    Looked holy through the sunset air

    And angellike the Muezzin told

    From tower and mosque the hour of
    prayer

    With cheerful steps the morrows dawn
    From Shiraz saw the stranger part

    The Starflower of the VirgiiirBorn
    Still blooming in his hopeful heart



    THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN

    Get ye up from the wrath of God
    rible day

    Ungirded unsandalled arise and away

    T is the vintage of blood
    of time

    And vengeance shall gather the harvest of
    crime

    The warning was spoken  the righteous
    had gone

    And the proud ones of Sodom were feast
    ing alone

    All gay was the banquet  the revel was
    long

    With the pourmg of wine and the breath
    ing of song

    T was an evening of beauty  the air was

    perfume
    The earth was all greenness the trees were

    all bloom
    And softly the delicate viol was heard
    Like the murmur of love or the notes of a

    bird

    And beautiful maidens moved down in the

    dance
    With the magic of motion and sunshine of

    glance
    And white arms wreathed lightly and

    tresses fell free
    As the plumage of birds in some tropical

    tree



    Where the shrines of foul idols were lighted
    on high

    And wantonness tempted the lust of the
    eye

    Midst rites of obsceneness strange loath
    some abhorred

    The blasphemer scoifed at the name of the
    Lord

    Hark  the growl of the thimder  the

    quaking of earth
    Woe woe to the worship and woe to the

    mirth
    The black sky has opened  there

    in the air
    The red arm of vengeance is lifted and

    bare

    Then the shriek of the dying rose wild
    where the song

    And the low tone of love had been whis
    pered along

    er pal
    ace and bower

    Like the red tongues of demons to blast
    and devour

    Down down on the fallen the red ruin
    rained

    And the reveller sank with his Avinecup
    undrained

    The foot of the dancer the music
    thrill

    And the shout and the laughter grew sud
    denly still

    The last throb of anguish was fearfully

    given
    The last eye glared forth in its madness on

    Heaven
    The last groan of horror rose wildly and

    vain
    And death brooded over the pride of the

    Plain

    Nor as the awful voice which came

    To Israel
    Nor as the tongues of cloven flame

    Nor gift of fearful words

    Not always thus with outward sign

    Of fire or voice from Heaven
    The message of a truth divine

    The call of God is given
    Awaking in the human heart

    Love for the true and right
    Zeal for the Christians better part

    Strength for the Christian

    Nor unto manhoods heart alone

    The holy influence steals
    Warm with a rapture not its own

    The heart of woman feels
    As she who by Samaria

    The Saviours errand sought
    As those who Avith the fervent Paul

    And meek Aquila wrought

    Or those meek ones whose martyrdom

    Rome
    Or those who in their Alpine home

    Braved the Crusaders war
    When the green Vaudois trembling heard

    Througli all its vales of death
    The martyr

    From womans failing breath

    And gently by a thousand things

    Which o
    Like breezes oer the harp

    Or vapors oer a glass
    Leaving their token strange and new

    Of music or of shade
    The summons to the right and true

    And merciful is made

    Oh then if gleams of truth and light

    Flash o
    Unfolding to thy mental sight

    The wants of humankind
    If brooding over human grief

    The earnest wish is known
    To sootlie and gladden with relief

    An anguish not thine own

    Though lieralded with naught of fear

    Or outward sign or show
    Though only to the inward ear

    It whispers soft and low



    Though dropping as the manna fell

    Unseen yet from above
    Noiseless as dewfall heed it well

    Sunlight upon Judfea

    And on the waves of Galilee
    On Jordans stream and on the rills

    That feed the dead and sleeping sea
    Most freshly from the green wood springs
    The light breeze on its scented wings
    And gayly quiver in the sun
    The cedar tops of Lebanon

    A few more hours  a change hath come

    The sky is dark without a cloud
    The shouts of wrath and joy are dumb

    And proud knees unto earth are bowed
    A change is on the hill of Death
    The helmed watchers pant for breath
    And turn with wild and maniac eyes
    From the dark scene of sacrifice

    That Sacrifice   the deatli of Him

    The Christ of God the holy One
    Well may the conscious Heaven grow dim

    And blacken the beholding Sun
    The wonted light hath fled away
    Night settles on the middle day
    And earthquake fi
    Is waking with a thrill of dread

    The dead are waking imderneath

    Their prison door is rent away
    And ghastly with the seal of death

    They wander in the eye of day
    The temple of the Cherubim
    The House of God is cold and dim
    A curse is on its trembling walls
    Its mighty veil asunder falls

    Well may the caverndepths of Earth
    Be shaken and her mountains nod

    Well may the sheeted dead come forth
    To see the suffering son of God

    Well may the templeshrine grow dim

    And shadows veil the Cherubim

    When He the chosen one of Heaven

    A sacrifice for guilt is given

    And shall the sinful heart alone
    Behold unmoved the fearful hour

    PALESTINE

    Blest land of Judaea  thrice hallowed of

    song
    Where the holiest of memories pilgrimlike

    throng
    In the shade of thy palms by the shores of

    thy sea
    On the hills of thy beauty my heart is with

    thee

    With the eye of a spirit I look on that

    shore
    Where pilgrim and prophet have lingered

    before
    With the glide of a spirit I traverse the

    sod
    Made bright by the steps of the angels of

    God

    Blue sea of the hills  in my spirit I hear
    Thy waters Gennesaret chime on my

    ear
    Where the Lowly and Just with the people

    sat down
    And thy spray on the dust of His sandals

    was thrown

    Beyond are Bethulias mountains of green
    And the desolate hills of the wild Gada

    rene
    And I pause on the goatcrags of Tabor to

    see
    The gleam of thy waters O dark Galilee

    Hark a sound in the valley  where swollen

    and strong
    Thy river O Kishon is sweeping along
    Where the Canaanite strove with Jehovah

    in vain
    And thy torrent grew dark with the blood

    of the slain

    There down from his mountains stern Zeb

    ulon came
    And Naphthali

    flame



    And the chariots of Jabin rolled harmlessly

    on
    s

    son

    There sleep the still rocks and the caverns
    which rang

    To the song which the beautiful prophetess
    sang

    When tlie princes of Issachar stood by her
    side

    And the shout of a host in its triumph re
    plied

    Lo Bethlehem
    With the moixntains around and the valleys

    between
    There rested the shepherds of Judah and

    there
    The song of the angels rose sweet on the

    air

    And Bethanys palmtrees in beauty still

    throw
    Their shadows at noon on the ruins below
    But where are the sisters who hastened to

    greet
    The lowly Redeemer and sit at His feet

    I tread where the twelve in their wayfaring
    trod

    I stand where they stood with the chosen of
    God

    Where His blessing was heard and His les
    sons were taught

    Where the blind were restored and the
    healing was wrought

    Oh here with His flock the sad Wanderer

    came
    These hills He toiled over in grief are the

    same
    The founts where He drank by the wayside

    still flow
    And the same airs are blowing which

    breathed on His brow

    And throned on her hills sits Jerusalem

    yet

    But with dust on her forehead and chains

    on her feet
    For the crown of her pride to the mocker

    hath gone
    And the holy Shechinah is dark where it

    shone

    But wherefore this dream of the earthly
    abode

    Of Humanity clothed in the brightness of
    God

    Were vay spirit but turned from the out
    ward and dim

    It could gaze even now on the presence of
    Him

    Not in clouds and in terrors but gentle as

    when
    In love and in meekness He moved among

    men
    And the voice which breathed peace to the

    waves of the sea
    In the hush of my spirit would whisper to

    me

    And what if my feet may not tread where

    He stood
    Nor my ears hear the dashing of Galilee

    Nor my eyes see the cross which He bowed

    The spirit surviveth the things of an hour

    Oh who the speed of bird and wind

    Was not my spirit born to shine

    Where yonder stars and suns are glow

    To breathe with them the light divine
    From Gods own holy altar flowing

    To be indeed whate

    In dreams hath thirsted for so long

    A portion of heavens glorious whole
    Of loveliness and song

    Oh watchers of the stars at night

    Who breathe their fire as we the air
    Suns thunders stars and rays of light

    Oh say is He the Eternal there
    Bend there around His awful throne

    The seraphs glance the angels knee
    Or are thy inmost depths His own

    O wild and mighty sea

    Thoughts of my soul how swift ye go

    Swift as the eagle
    s bow

    To the far aim of your desire
    Thought after thought ye thronging rise

    Like springdoves from the startled wood
    Bearing like them your sacrifice

    Of music unto God

    And shall these thoughts of joy and love

    Come back again no more to me
    Returning like the patriarch

    Wingweary from the eternal sea
    To bear within my longing arms

    The promisebough of kindlier skies
    Plucked from the green immortal palms

    Which shadow Paradise

    Allmoving spirit  freely forth

    At Thy command the strong wind goes

    Its errand to the passive earth

    Nor art can stay nor strength oppose

    Until it folds its weary wing
    Once more within the hand divine

    So weary from its wandering
    My spirit turns to Thine

    C hild of the sea the mountain stream

    From its dark caverns hurries on
    s beam

    By evenings star and noontides sun
    Until at last it sinks to rest

    O
    s breast

    So turns my soul to Thee

    O Thou who bidst the torrent flow

    Who lendest wings unto the wind
    Mover of all things  where art Thou

    Oh whither shall I go to find
    The secret of Thy restingplace

    Is there no holy wing for me
    That soaring I may search the space

    Of highest heaven for Thee

    Oh would I were as free to rise

    As leaves on autumn
    The arrowy light of sunset skies

    Or sound or ray or star of morn
    s close

    Or aught which soars unchecked and free
    Through earth and heaven  that I might
    lose

    Myself in finding Thee

    LE CRI DE l

    Quand le souffle divin qui flotte sur le ruonde

    When the breath divine is flowing
    Zephyrlike oer all things going
    And as the touch of viewless fingers
    Softly on my soul it lingers
    Open to a breath the lightest
    Conscious of a touch the slightest
    As some calm still lake whereon
    Sinks the snowybosomed swan
    And the glistening waterrings
    Circle roiuid her moving wings
    When my upward gaze is turning
    Where the stars of heaven are burning



    Through the deep and dark abyss
    Flowers of midnight
    s breath
    Sweetly in their Maker
    When the breaking day is flushing
    All the east and light is gushing
    s haze
    Sheaflike with its thousand rays
    Spreading until all above
    Overflows with joy and love
    And below on earth
    All is changed to light and blossom

    When my waking fancies over
    Forms of brightness flit and hover
    Holy as the seraphs are
    Who by Zions fountains wear
    On their foreheads white and broad
    Holiness unto the Lord
    When inspired with rapture high
    It would seem a single sigh
    Could a world of love create
    That my life could know no date
    And my eager thoughts could fill
    Heaven and Earth o

    Then O Father  Thou alone

    From the shadow of Thy throne

    To the sighing of my breast

    And its rapture answerest

    All my thoughts which upward winging

    Bathe where Thy own light is springing

    All my yearnings to be free

    Are as echoes answering Thee

    Seldom upon lips of mine
    Father  rests that name of Thine
    Deep within my inmost breast
    In the secret place of mind
    Like an awful presence shrined
    Doth the dreacl idea rest
    Hushed and holy dwells it there
    Prompter of the silent prayer
    Lifting up my spirits eye
    And its faint but earnest cry
    From its dark and cold abode
    Unto Thee my Guide and God

    First and of the established Episcopacy The
    Quakers Baptists and Catholics were banished
    on pain of death from the Massachusetts Col
    ony One Samuel Gorton a bold and eloquent
    declaimer after preaching for a time in Bos
    ton against the doctrines of the Puritans and
    declaring that their churches were mere hu
    man devices and their sacrament and baptism
    an abomination was driven out of the juris
    diction of the colony and compelled to seek a
    residence among the savages He gathered
    round him a considerable number of converts
    who like the primitive Christians shared all
    things in common His opinions however
    were so troublesome to the leading clergy of
    the colony that they instigated an attack
    upon his  Family  by an armed force which
    seized upon the principal men m it and
    brought them into Massachusetts where they
    were sentenced to be kept at hard labor in
    several towns one only in each town during
    the pleasure of the General Court they being
    forbidden under severe penalties to utter any
    of their religious sentiments except to such
    ministers as might labor for their conversion
    They were unquestionably sincere in their
    opinions and whatever may have been their
    errors deserve to be ranked among those who
    have in all ages suffered for the freedom of

    Father  to Thy suffering poor

    Strengtli and grace and faith impart
    And with Thy own love restore

    Comfort to the broken heart
    Oh the failing ones confirm

    With a holier strength of zeal
    Give Thou not the feeble worm

    s heel

    Father  for Thy holy sake

    We are spoiled and hunted thus
    Joyful for Thy truth we take

    Bonds and burthens unto us
    Poor and weak and robbed of all

    Weary with our daily task
    That Thy truth may never fall

    Through our weakness Lord we ask

    Round our fired and wasted homes

    Flits the forestbird unscared
    And at noon the wild beast comes

    Where our frugal meal was shared
    For the song of praises there

    Shrieks the crow the livelong day
    For the sound of evening prayer

    Howls the evil beast of prey



    Sweet the songs we loved to sing

    Underneath Thy holy sky
    Words and tones that used to bring

    Tears of joy in every eye
    Dear the wrestling hours of prayer

    When we gathered knee to knee
    Blameless youth and hoary hair

    Bowed O God alone to Thee

    As Thine early children Lord

    Shared their wealth and daily bread
    Even so with one accord

    We in love each other fed
    Not with us the miser

    Not with us his grasping hand
    Equal round a common board

    Drew our meek and brother band

    Safe our quiet Eden lay

    When the warwhoop stirred the land
    And the Indian turned away

    From our home his bloody hand
    Well that forestranger saw

    That the burthen and the curse
    Of the white mans cruel law

    Rested also upon us

    Torn apart and driven forth

    To our toiling hard and long
    Father  from the dust of earth

    Lift we still our grateful song
    Grateful that in bonds we share

    In Thy love which maketh free
    Joyful that the wrongs we bear

    Draw us nearer Lord to Thee

    Grateful  that where

    By Wachusets wooded side
    On Nantucket

    Or by wild Neponsets tide
    Still in spirit we are near

    And our evening hymns which rise
    Separate and discordant here

    Meet and mingle in the skies

    Let the scoffer scorn and mock

    Let the proud and evil priest
    Rob the needy of his flock

    For his winecnji and his feast
    Redden not Thy bolts in store

    Tlirongh the blackness of Thy skies
    For the sighing of the poor

    Wilt Thou not at length arise

    Worn and wasted oh  how long

    Shall thy trodden poor complain
    In Thy name they bear the wrong

    In Thy cause the bonds of pain
    Melt oppression

    Let the haughty priesthood see
    And their blinded followers feel

    That in us they mock at Thee

    In Thy time O Lord of hosts

    Stretch abroad that hand to save
    Which of old on Egypts coasts

    Smote apart the Red Sea
    Lead us from this evil land

    From the spoiler set us free
    Aiid once more our gathered band

    Heart to heart shall worship Thee

    They hear Thee not O God  nor see

    Beneath Thy rod they mock at Thee

    The princes of our ancient line

    Lie drunken with Assyrian wine

    The priests around Thy altar speak

    The false words which their hearers seek

    s wanton maids

    Have sung in Dura

    Are with the Levites chant ascending

    With Zion

    On Israels bleeding bosom set

    The heathen heel is crushing yet

    The towers upon our holy hill

    Echo Chaldean footsteps still

    Our wasted shrines  who weeps for

    them
    Who mourneth for Jerusalem
    Who turneth from his gains away
    Wiiose knee with mine is bowed to pray
    Who leaving feast and purpling cup
    Takes Zion

    A sad and thouglitful youth I went
    With Israels early banishment
    And where the sullen Chebar crept
    The ritual of my fathers kept
    The water for the trench I drew
    The firstling of the flock I slew
    And standing at the altar
    I shared the Levites lingering pride
    That still amidst her mocking foes
    The smoke of Zion



    In sudden whirlwind cloud and flame
    The Spirit of the Highest came
    Before mine eyes a vision passed
    A glory terrible and vast
    With dreadful eyes of living things
    And sounding sweep of angel wings
    With circling light and sapphire throne
    And flamelike form of One thereon
    And voice of that dread Likeness sent
    Down from the crystal firmament

    s power

    Fell on me in that fearful hour

    From off unutterable woes

    The ciu

    I saw far down the coming time

    The fiery chastisement of crime

    With noise of mingling hosts and jar

    Of falling towers and shouts of war

    I saw the nations rise and fall

    s white wall

    In dream and trance I saw the slain
    Of Egypt heaped like harvest grain
    I saw the walls of seaborn Tyre
    Swept over by the sjjoiler
    And heard the low expiring moan
    Of Edom on his rocky throne
    And woe is me  the wild lament
    From Zions desolation sent
    And felt within my heart each blow
    Which laid her holy places low

    In bonds and sorrow day by day

    Before the jjictured tile I lay

    And there as in a mirror saw

    The coming of Assyria

    Her swarthy lines of spearmen pass

    s grass

    I saw them draw their stormy hem

    Of battle romid Jerusalem

    And listening heard the Hebrew wail

    Blend with the victortrumjj of Baal

    Who trembled at my warning word
    Who owned the prophet of the Lord
    How mocked the xude how scoffed the

    vile
    How stung the Levites
    As oer my spirit dark and slow
    The shadow crept of Israel
    As if the angels mournful roll
    Had left its record on my soul
    And traced in lines of darkness there
    The picture of its great despair

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Yet ever at the hour I feel
    My lips in prophecy unseal
    Prince priest and Levite gather near
    And Salem
    On Chebars waste and alien shore
    The harp of Judah swept once more
    They listen as in Babel
    s song
    Or wild sabbeka
    As careless and as vain as they



    And thus O Prophetbard of old
    Hast thou thy tale of sorrow told
    The same which earths unwelcome seers
    Have felt in all succeeding years
    Sport of the changeful multitude
    Nor calmly heard nor understood
    Their song has seemed a trick of art
    Their warnings but the actor
    With bonds and scorn and evil will
    The world requites its prophets still

    So was it when the Holy One
    The garments of the flesh put on
    Men followed where the Highest led
    For common gifts of daily bread
    And gross of ear of vision dim
    Owned not the Godlike power of Him
    Vain as a dreamers words to them
    His wail above Jerusalem
    And meaningless the watch He kept
    Through which His weak disciples slept

    Yet shrink not thou whoe
    For Gods great purpose set apart
    Before whose fardiscerning eyes
    The Future as the Present lies
    Beyond a narrowbounded age
    Stretches thy prophetheritage
    Through Heaven
    And through the eternal years of God
    Thy audience worlds   all things to be
    The witness of the Truth in thee



    WHAT THE VOICE SAID

    Maddened by Earths wrong and evil
    Lord   I cried in sudden ire

    From Thy right hand clothed with thun
    der
    Shake the bolted fire



    Love is lost and Faith is dying
    With the brute the man is sold
    And the dropping blood of labor
    Hardens into gold

    Here the dying wail of Famine
    There the battles groan of pain
    And in silence smoothfaced Mammon
    Reaping men like grain

    Where is God that we should fear
    Hhn
    Thus the earthborn Titans say
    God  if Thou art living hear us
    Thus the weak ones pray

    Thou the patient Heaven upbraiding
    Spake a solemn Voice within

    Weary of our Lord
    Art thou free from sin

    Fearless brow to Him uplifting
    Canst thou for His thunders call
    Knowing that to guilts attraction
    Evermore they fall

    Knowst thou not all germs of evil
    In thy heart await their time
    Not thyself but Gods restraining
    Stays their growth of crime

    Couldst thou boast O child of weakness
    O
    Were theii strong temptations planted
    In thy path of life

    Thou hast seen two streamlets gushing
    From one fountain clear and free
    But by widely varying channels
    Searching for the sea

    Glideth one through greenest valleys
    Kissing them Avith lips still sweet
    One mad roaring down the mountains
    Stagnates at their feet

    Is it choice whereby the Parsee
    Kneels before his mothers fire
    In liis black tent did the Tartar
    Choose liis wandering sire

    He alone whose hand is bounding
    Human power and human will
    Looking through each soul
    Knows its good or ill

    For thyself while wrong and sorrow
    Make to thee their strong appeal
    Coward wert thou not to utter
    What the heart must feel

    Earnest words must needs be spoken
    When the warm heart bleeds or burns
    With its scorn of wrong or pity
    For the wronged by turns

    s weakness
    Hidden faults and follies known
    Be thou in rebuking evil
    Conscious of thine own

    Not the less shall sterneyed Duty
    To thy lips her trumpet set
    But with harsher blasts shall mingle
    Wailings of regret

    Cease not Voice of holy speaking
    Teacher sent of God be near

    Whispering through the day
    Let my spirit hear

    So when thoughts of evildoers
    Waken scorn or hatred move

    Shall a mournful fellowfeeling
    Temper all with love

    A FREE PARAPHRASE OF THE GERMAN

    To weary hearts to mourning homes
    Gods meekest Angel gently comes
    No power has he to banish pain
    Or give us back our lost again
    And yet in tenderest love our dear
    And Heavenly Father sends him here

    There s quiet in that Angels glance

    There

    He mocks no grief with idle cheer

    s ear

    But ills and woes he may not cure

    He kindly trains us to endure

    Angel of Patience  sent to calm
    Our feverish brows with cooling palm
    To lay the storms of hope and fear
    And reconcile life
    The throbs of wounded pride to still
    s will



    O thou who mournest on thy way
    With longings for the close of day
    He walks with thee that Angel kind
    And gently whispers
    Bear up bear on the end shall tell
    The dear Lord ordereth all things well



    THE WIFE OF MANOAH TO HER
    HUSBAND

    Against the sunsets glowing wall
    The city towers rise black and tall
    Where Zorah on its rocky height
    Stands like an armed man in the light

    Down Eshtaols vales of ripened grain
    Falls like a cloud the night amain
    And up the hillsides climbing slow
    The barley reapers homeward go

    Look dearest  how our fair childs head
    The sunset light hath hallowed
    Where at this olives foot he lies
    Uplooking to the tranquil skies

    Oh while beneath the fervent heat

    Thy sickle swept the bearded wheat

    I ve watched with mingled joy and dread

    Our child upon his grassy bed

    Joy which the mother feels alone
    Whose morning hope like mine had flown
    When to her bosom overblessed
    A dearer life than hers is pressed

    Dread for the future dark and still
    Which shapes our dear one to its will
    Forever in his large calm eyes
    I read a tale of sacrifice

    The same foreboding awe I felt
    When at the altars side we knelt
    And he who as a pilgrim came
    Rose winged and glorious through the
    flame

    I slept not though the wild bees made
    A dreamlike murmuring in the shade
    And on me the warmfingered hours
    Pressed with the drowsy smell of flowers

    Before me in a vision rose

    The hosts of Israels scornful foes

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Rank over rank helm shield and spear
    Glittered in noons hot atmosphere

    I heard their boast and bitter word
    Their mockery of the Hebrews Lord
    I saw their hands His ark assail
    Their feet profane His holy veil

    No angel down the blue space spoke
    No thunder from the still sky broke
    But in their midst in power and awe
    Like Gods waked wrath our child I saw

    A child no more   harsh  browed and

    strong
    He towered a giant in the throng
    And down his shoulders broad and bare
    Swept the black terror of his hair

    He raised his arm  he smote amain
    As round the reaper falls the grain
    So the dark host around him fell
    So sank the foes of Israel

    Again I looked In sunlight shone
    The towers and domes of Askelon
    Priest warrior slave a mighty crowd
    Within her idol temple bowed

    Yet one knelt not  stark gaunt and blind
    His arms the massive jjillars twined
    An eyeless captive strong with hate
    He stood there like an evil Fate

    The red shrines smoked  the trumpets

    pealed
    He stooped  the giant columns reeled
    Reeled tower and fane sank arch and wall
    And the thick dustcloud closed oer all

    Above the shriek the crash the groan
    Of the fallen pride of Askelon
    I heard sheer down the echoing sky
    A voice as of an angel cry

    The voice of him who at our side
    Sat through the golden eventide
    Of him who on thy altars blaze
    Rose firewinged with his song of praise

    Rejoice oer Israels broken chain
    Gray mother of the mighty slain
    Rejoice   it cried he vanquisheth
    The strong in life is strong in death



    To him shall Zorahs daughters raise
    Through coming years their hymns of

    2Jraise
    And gray old men at evening tell
    Of all he wrought for Israel

    And they who sing and they who hear
    Alike shall hold thy memory dear
    And pour their blessings on thy head

    mother of the mighty dead

    It ceased  and though a sound I heard
    As if great wings the still air stirred

    1 only saw the barley sheaves
    And hills half hid by olive leaves

    I bowed my face in awe and fear

    On the dear child who slumbered near

    With me as with my only son

    O God I said  Thy will be done



    MY SOUL AND I

    Stand still my soul in the silent dark

    I would question thee
    Alone in the shadow drear and stark

    With God and me

    What my soul was thy errand here

    Was it mirth or ease
    Or heajjing up dust from year to year

    Nay none of these

    Speak soul aright in His holy sight

    Whose eye looks still
    And steadily on thee through the night

    To do His will

    What hast thou done O soul of mine

    That thou treinblest so
    Hast thou wrought His task and kept the
    line

    He bade thee go

    What silent all  art sad of cheer

    Art fearful now
    When God seemed far and men were near

    How brave wert thou

    Aha  thou tremblest   well I see

    Thou rt craven grown
    Is it so hard with God and me

    To stand alone



    MY SOUL AND I



    427



    Summon thy sunshine bravery back

    wretched sprite

    Iet me hear thy voice through this deep
    and black
    Abysmal night

    What hast thou wrought for Right and
    Truth
    For God and Man
    From the golden hours of bright  eyed
    youth
    To lifes mid span

    Ah soul of mine thy tones I hear

    But weak and low
    Like far sad murmurs on my ear

    They come and go

    I have wrestled stoutly with the Wrong

    And borne the Right
    From beneath the footfall of the throng

    To life and light

    Wherever Freedom shivered a chain

    God speed quoth I
    To Error amidst her shouting train

    1 gave the lie

    Ah soul of mine  ah soul of mine

    Thy deeds are well
    Were they wTought for Truth
    thine

    My soul pray tell

    Of all the work my hand hath wrought

    Beneath the sky
    Save a place in kindly human thought

    No gain have I

    Go to go to  for thy very self

    Thy deeds were done
    Thou for fame the miser for pelf

    Your end is one

    And where art thou going soul of mine

    Canst see the end
    And whither this troubled life of thine

    Evermore doth tend

    What daunts thee now  what shakes thee
    so

    My sad soul say
    I see a cloud like a curtain low

    Haug o



    Whither I go I cannot tell

    That cloud hangs black
    High as the heaven and deep as hell

    Across my track

    I see its shadow coldly enwrap

    The souls before
    Sadly they enter it step by step

    To return no more

    They shrink they shudder dear God
    they kneel

    To Thee in prayer
    They shut their eyes on the cloud but feel

    That it still is there

    In vain they turn from the dread Be
    fore

    To the Known and Gone
    For while gazing behind them evermore

    Their feet glide on

    Yet at times I see upon sweet pale faces

    A light begin
    To tremble as if from holy places

    And shrines within

    And at times methinks their cold lips
    move

    With hymn and prayer
    As if somewhat of awe but more of love

    And hope were there

    I call on the souls who have left the
    light

    To reveal their lot
    I bend mine ear to that wall of night

    And they answer not

    But I hear around me sighs of pain

    And the ciy of fear
    And a sound like the slow sad dropping of
    rain

    Each drop a tear

    Ah the cloud is dark and day by day

    I am moving thither
    I must pass beneath it on my way

    God pity me   whither

    Ah soul of mine  so brave and wise

    In the lifestorm loud
    Fronting so calmly all human eyes

    In the sunlit crowd

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Now staudiug apart with God and me

    Thou ai
    Gazing vainly after the things to be

    Through Deaths dread wall

    But never for this never for this

    Was thy being lent
    For the craven

    Like his merriment

    Folly and Fear are sisters twain

    One closing her eyes
    The other peopling the dark inane

    With spectral lies

    s hand controls

    Whate
    Round Hun in calmest music rolls

    Whateer thou hearest

    What to thee is shadow to Him is day
    And the end He knoweth

    And not on a blind and aimless way
    The spirit goeth

    Man sees no future  a phantom show

    Is alone before him
    Past Time is dead and the grasses grow

    And flowers bloom o

    Nothing before nothing behind

    The steps of Faith
    Fall on the seeming void and find

    The rock beneath

    The Present the Present is all thou hast

    For thy sure possessing
    Like the patriarchs angel hold it fast

    Till it gives its blessing

    Why fear the night  why shrink from
    Death
    That pliantom wan
    There is nothing in heaven or earth be
    neath
    Save God and man

    Peopling the shadows we turn from Him

    And from one another
    All is spectral and vague and dim

    Save God and our brother

    Like warp and woof all destinies
    Are woven fast



    Linked in sympathy like the keys
    Of an organ vast

    Pluck one thread and the web ye mar

    Break but one
    Of a thousand keys and the paining jar

    Through all will run

    O restless spirit  wherefore strain

    Beyond thy sphere
    Heaven and hell with their joy and pain

    Are now and here

    Back to thyself is measured well

    All thou hast given
    Thy neighbor

    His bliss thy heaven

    And in life in death in dark and light

    All are in Gods care
    Sound the black abyss pierce the deep of
    night

    And He is there

    All which is real now remaineth

    And fadeth never
    The hand which upholds it now sustaineth

    The soul forever

    Leaning on Him make with reverent meek
    ness
    His own thy will
    And with strength from Him shall thy ut
    ter weakness
    Life

    And that cloud itself which now before
    thee
    Lies dark in view
    Shall with beams of light from the inner
    glory
    Be stricken thiougli

    s
    dawn

    Uprolling thin
    Its thickest folds when about thee drawn

    Let sunlight in

    Then of what is to be and of what is
    done

    Why queriest thou
    The past and the time to be are one

    And both are now

    WORSHIP

    Pure religion and imdefiled before God and the Fa
    ther is this To visit the fatherless and widows in their
    afHiction and to keep himself unspotted from the world
    James i 27

    The Pagan
    are spoken
    And ghosts of old Beliefs still flit and
    moan
    Round fane and altar overthrown and
    broken
    Oer treegrown barrow and gray ring of
    stone

    Blind Faith had martyrs in those old high
    places
    The Syrian hill grove and the Druid
    wood
    s
    embraces
    Bone of their bone and blood of their
    own blood

    Red altars kindling tlirough that night of
    error
    Smoked with warm blood beneath the
    cruel eye
    Of lawless Power and sanguinary Terror
    Throned on the circle of a pitiless sky

    Beneath whose baleful shadow overcasting
    All heaven above and blighting earth
    below
    The scourge grew red the lip grew pale
    with fasting
    And man
    woe

    Then through great temples swelled the
    dismal moaning
    Of dirge  like music and sepulchral
    prayer
    Pale wizard priests oer occult symbols
    droning
    Swung their white censers in the bur
    dened air

    As if the pomp of rituals and the savor
    Of gums and spices could the Unseen
    One please
    As if His ear could bend with childish
    favor
    To the poor flattery of the organ keys I



    Feet red from warfields trod the church
    aisles holy
    With trembling reverence  and the op
    pressor there
    Kneeling before his priest abased and
    lowly
    Crushed human hearts beneath his knee
    of prayer

    Not such the service the benignant Father
    Requireth at His earthly children
    hands
    Not the poor offering of vain rites but
    rather
    The simple duty man from man demands

    For Earth He asks it  the full joy of
    heaven
    Knoweth no change of waning or in
    crease
    The great heart of the Infinite beats even
    Untroubled flows the river of His peace

    He asks no taper lights on high surround
    ing
    The priestly altar and the saintly grave
    No dolorous chant nor organ music sound

    Nor incense clouding up the twilight
    nave

    For he whom Jesus loved hath truly
    spoken
    The holier worship which he deigns to
    bless
    Restores the lost and binds the spirit
    broken
    And feeds the widow and the fatherless

    Types of our human weakness and our sor
    row
    Who lives unhaunted by his loved ones
    dead
    Who with vain longing seeketh not to
    borrow
    From stranger eyes the home lights
    which have fled

    O brother man  fold to thy heart thy
    brother
    Where pity dwells the peace of God is
    there
    To worship rightly is to love each other
    Each smile a hymn each kindly deed a
    prayer

    Adieu to Marseilles beginning

    Je nai pas navigui5 eur loc§an de sable

    I HAVE not felt o

    The rocking of the desert bark
    Nor laved at Hebrons fount my hand

    By Hebron
    Nor pitched my tent at evenfall

    On dust where Job of old has lain
    Nor dreamed beneath its canvas wall

    The dream of Jacob oer again

    One vast worldpage remains unread

    How shine the stars in Chaldea
    s tread

    How beats the heart with God so nigh
    How round gray arch and column lone

    The spirit of the old time broods
    And sighs in all the winds that moan

    Along the sandy solitudes

    In thy tall cedars Lebanon

    I have not heard the nations
    Nor seen thy eagles stooping down

    Where buried Tyre in ruin lies
    The Christians prayer I have not said

    In Tadmor
    Nor startled with my dreary tread

    The waste where Memnons empire lay

    Nor have I from thy hallowed tide
    O Jordan  heard the low lament

    Like that sad wail along thy side

    Which Israel

    Nor thrilled witliin that grotto lone

    Where deep in night the Bard of Kings



    Felt hands of fire direct his own

    And sweep for God the conscious strings

    I have not climbed to Olivet

    Nor laid me where my Saviour lay
    And left His trace of tears as yet

    By angel eyes unwept away
    s solemn time

    The garden where His prayer and groan
    Wrung by His sorrow and our crime

    Rose to One listening ear alone

    I have not kissed the rockhewn grot

    AVhere in His mother
    Nor knelt upon the sacred spot

    Where last His footsteps pressed the
    clay
    Nor looked on that sad mountain head

    Nor smote my sinful breast where wide
    His arms to fold the world He spread

    And bowed His head to bless  and died



    THE REWARD

    Who looking backward from his man
    hoods prime
    Sees not the spectre of bis misspent time

    And through the shade
    Of funeral cypress planted thick behind
    Hears no reproachful whisper on the wind

    From his loved dead

    Who bears no trace of passion
    Who shuns thy sting O terrible Remorse

    Who does not cast
    s

    book
    At times a sad and halfreluctant look

    Regretful of the past

    Alas  the evil which we fain would shun
    We do and leave the wishedfor good un
    done

    Is but tomorrow
    Poor blind unprofitable servants all

    Are we alway

    THE WISH OF TODAY

    I ASK not now for gold to gild

    With mocking shine a weary frame

    The yearning of the mind is stilled
    I ask not now for Fame

    A rosecloud dimly seen above

    Melting in heaven

    Oh sweet fond dream of human Love
    For thee I may not pray

    But bowed in lowliness of mind

    I make my humble wishes known
    I only ask a will resigned

    Father to Thine own

    Today beneath Thy chastening eye

    1 crave alone for peace and rest
    Submissive in Thy hand to lie

    And feel that it is best

    A marvel seems the Universe
    A miracle our Life and Death

    A mystery which I cannot pierce
    Around above beneath

    In vain I task my aching brain
    In vain the sages thought I scan

    I only feel how weak and vain
    How poor and blind is man

    And now my spirit sighs for home
    And longs for light whereby to see



    And like a weary child would come
    O Father unto Thee

    Though oft like letters traced on sand
    My weak resolves have passed away

    In mercy lend Thy helping hand
    Unto my prayer today

    A dumb despair a wandering death

    To that dark weltering horror came
    Thy spirit like a subtle flame
    A breath of life electrical
    Awakening and transforming all
    Till beat and thrilled in every part
    The pulses of a living heart

    Then knew their bounds the land and sea
    Then smiled the bloom of mead and tree
    From flower to moth from beast to man
    The quick creative impulse ran
    And earth with life from thee renewed
    Was in thy holy eyesight good

    As lost and void as dark and cold

    And formless as that earth of old

    A wandering waste of storm and night

    Midst spheres of song and realms of light

    A blot upon thj holy sky

    Untouched unwarned of thee am I

    O Thou who movest on the deep

    Of spirits wake my own from sleep

    QUESTIONS OF LIFE

    And the angel that was sent unto me whose name
    was Uriel gave me an answer

    And said Tliy heart hath gone too far in this world
    and thinkest thou to comprehend the way of the Most
    High

    Then said I Tea my Lord

    Then said he unto me Go thy way weigh me the
    weight of the fire or measure me the blast of the wind
    or call me again the hour that is past  2 Esdras ch iv

    A BENDING staff I would not break
    A feeble faith I would not shake
    Nor even rashly pluck away
    The error which some truth may stay
    Whose loss might leave the soul without
    A shield against the shafts of doubt

    And yet at times when over all

    A darker mystery seems to fall

    May God forgive the child of dust

    Who seeks to know where Faith should

    trust
    I raise the questions old and dark
    Of Uzdom
    And speechconfounded build again
    s plain

    I am  how little more I know
    Wlience came I  Whither do I go
    A centred self which feels and is
    A cry between the silences
    A shadowbirth of clouds at strife
    With sunshine on the hills of life
    A shaft from Nature
    Into the Future from the Past
    Between the cradle and the shroud
    A meteors flight from cloud to cloud

    Thorough the vastness arching all

    I see the great stars rise and fall

    The rounding seasons come and go

    The tided oceans ebb and flow

    The tokens of a central force

    Whose circles in their widening course

    O

    The workings of the law whence springs

    The rhytlmiic harmony of things

    Which shapes in earth the darkling spar

    And orbs in heaven the morning star



    Of all I see in earth and sky
    Star flower beastbird  what part have I
    This conscious life  is it the same
    Which thrills the universal frame
    Whereby the caverned crystal shoots
    And mounts the sap from forest roots
    Whereby the exiled woodbird tells
    When Spring makes green her native dells
    How feels the stone the pang of birth
    Which brings its sparkling prism forth
    The foresttree the throb which gives
    The lifeblood to its newborn leaves
    Do bird and blossom feel like me
    Lifes manyfolded mystery
    The wonder which it is to be
    Or stand I severed and distinct
    From Nature
    Allied to all yet not the less
    Prisoned in separate consciousness
    Alone oerburdened with a sense
    Of life and cause and consequence

    In vain to me the Sphinx propounds
    The riddle of her sights and sounds
    Back still the vaulted mystery gives
    The echoed question it receives
    What sings the brook  What oracle
    Is m the pinetree
    What may the winds low burden be
    The meaning of the moaning sea
    The hieroglyphics of the stars
    Or clouded sunset
    I vainly ask for mocks my skill
    The trick of Natures cipher still

    I turn from Nature unto men

    I ask the stylus and the pen

    What sang the bards of old  What meant

    The prophets of the Orient

    The rolls of buried Egypt hid

    In painted tomb and pyramid

    What mean Idiimea

    Or dusk Eloras monstrous signs

    How speaks the primal thought of man

    From the grim carvings of Copan

    Where rests the secret  Where the keys

    Of the old deathbolted mysteries

    Alas  the dead retain their trust

    Dust hath no answer from the dust

    The great enigma still unguessed

    Unanswered the eternal quest

    I gather up the scattered rays

    Of wisdom in the early days

    Faint gleams and broken like the light



    FIRSTDAY THOUGHTS



    433



    Of meteors in a northern night

    Betraying to the darkling earth

    Tlie unseen sun which gave them birth

    I listen to the sibyl

    The voice of priest and hierophant

    I know what Indian Kreeshna saitli

    And what of life and what of death

    The demon taught to Socrates

    And what beneatli his gardentrees

    Slow pacing with a dreamlike tread

    The solemnthoughted Plato said

    Nor lack I tokens great or small

    Of Gods clear light in each and all

    While holding with more dear regard

    The scroll of Hebrew seer and bard

    The starry pages promiselit

    With Christ

    Thy miracle of life and death

    O Holy One of Nazareth

    On Aztec ruins gray and lone
    The circling serpent coils in stone
    Type of the endless and unknown
    Whereof we seek the clue to find
    With groping fingers of the blind
    Forever sought and never found
    We trace that serpentsymbol round
    Our restingplace our starting bound
    Oh thriftlessness of dream and guess
    Oh wisdom which is foolishness
    Why idly seek from outward things
    The answer inward silence brings
    Why stretch beyond our proper spliere
    And age for that which lies so near
    Why climb the faroff hills with pain
    A nearer view of heaven to gain
    In lowliest depths of bosky dells
    The hermit Contemplation dwells
    A foimtains pinehung slope his seat
    And lotustwined his silent feet
    Whence piercing heaven with screened

    sight
    He sees at noon the stars whose light
    Shall glorify the coming night

    Here let me pause my quest forego
    Enough for me to feel and know
    That He in wliom the cause and end
    The past and future meet and blend
    Who girt with his Immensities
    Our vast and starhung system sees
    Small as the clustered Pleiades
    Moves not alone the heavenly quires
    But waves the springtime



    Guards not archangel feet alone

    But deigns to guide and keep my own

    Speaks not alone the words of fate

    Which worlds destroy and worlds create

    s ear

    In tones of love or warning fear

    A language none beside may hear

    To Him from wanderings long and wild

    I come an overwearied child

    In cool and shade His peace to find

    Like dewfall settling on my mind

    Assured that all I know is best

    And humbly trusting for the rest

    I turn from Fancy

    Dark creed and mournful eastern dream

    Of power impersonal and cold

    Controlling all itself controlled

    Maker and slave of iron laws

    Alike the subject and the cause

    From vain philosophies that try

    The sevenfold gates of mystery

    And baffled ever babble still

    Wordprodigal of fate and will

    From Nature and her mockery Art

    And book and speech of men apart

    To the still witness in my heart

    With reverence waiting to behold

    His Avatflr of love untold

    The Eternal Beauty new and old



    FIRSTDAY THOUGHTS

    In calm and cool and silence once again
    I find my old accustomed place among
    My brethren where perchance no hu
    man tongue
    Shall utter words  where never hymn

    is sung
    Nor deeitoned organ blown nor censer
    swung
    Nor dim light falling through the pictured

    pane
    There syllabled by silence let me hear
    The still small voice which reached the

    prophets ear
    Read in my heart a still diviner law
    Than Israel
    There let me strive with each besetting sin
    Recall my wandering fancies and re
    strain
    The sore disquiet of a restless brain
    And as the path of duty is made plain

    May grace be given that I may walk
    therein
    Not like the hireling for his selfish gain
    With backward glances and reluctant tread
    Making a merit of his coward dread

    But cheerful in the light around me

    thrown
    Walking as one to pleasant service led
    Doing Gods will as if it were my own

    The same old baffling questions  O my

    friend
    I cannot answer them In vain I send
    My soul into the dark where never biun

    light
    Of Reason
    Their great and solemn meanings nor dis

    The awful secrets of the eyes which turn
    Evermore on us through the day and

    night
    With silent challenge and a dumb de

    Proffering the riddles of the dread un
    known
    Like the calm Sphinxes with their eyes of

    Questioning the centuries from their veils

    TRINITAS

    At morn I prayed
    How Three are One and One is Three
    Read the dark riddle unto me

    I wandered forth the sun and air
    I saw bestowed with equal care
    On good and evil foul and fair



    No partial favor dropped the rain
    Alike the righteous and profane
    Rejoiced above their heading grain

    And my heart murmured
    That blindfold Nature thus should treat
    With equal hand the tares and wheat

    A presence melted through my mood
    A warmth a light a sense of good
    Like sunshine through a winter wood

    I saw that presence mailed complete
    In her white innocence pause to greet
    A fallen sister of the street

    Upon her bosom snowy pure
    The lost one clung as if seciire
    From inward guilt or outward lure

    Beware   I said
    No gain to her but loss to thee
    Who touches pitch defiled must be

    I passed the haunts of shame and sin
    And a voice whispered
    Shall these lost souls to Heavens peace
    win

    Who there shall hope and health dis
    pense
    And lift the ladder up from thence
    Whose rounds are prayers of penitence

    I said  No higher life they know
    These earthworms love to have it so
    Who stoops to raise them sinks as low

    That night with painful care I read
    What Hippos saint and Calvin said
    The living seeking to the dead

    In vain I turned in weary quest
    Old pages where God give them rest
    The poor creed  mongers dreamed and
    guessed

    And still I prayed  Lord let me see
    How Three are One and One is Three
    Read the dark riddle unto me

    Dost thou

    pray
    For what thou hast  This very day
    The Holy Three have crossed thy way



    THE ROCK IN EL GHOR



    435



    Did not the gifts of sun and air

    To good and ill alike declare

    The allcompassionate Fathers care

    In the white sonl that stooped to raise

    The lost one from her evil ways

    Thou saw

    A bodiless Divinity

    The still small Voice that spake to thee

    Was the Holy Spirits mystery

    O blind of sight of faith how small
    Father and Son and Holy Call
    This day thou hast denied them all

    Kevealed in love and sacrifice
    The Holiest passed before thine eyes
    One and the same in threefold guise

    The equal Father in rain and sun
    His Christ in the good to evil done
    His Voice in thy soul   and the Three are
    One

    I shut my grave Aquinas fast
    The monkisli gloss of ages past
    The schoolmans creed aside I cast

    And my heart answered
    How Three are One and One is Three
    Thy riddle hath been read to me

    The shade for me but over thee
    The lingering sunshine still

    As smiling to the silent stream
    Comes down the singing rill

    So come to me my little one
    My years with thee I share

    And mingle with a sister
    A mothers tender care

    But keep the smile upon thy lip

    The trust upon thy brow
    Since for the dear one God hath called

    Ve have an angel now

    Our mother from the fields of heaven
    Shall still her ear incline



    Nor need we fear her human love
    Is less for love divine

    The songs are sweet they sing beneath

    Tlie trees of life so fair
    But sweetest of the songs of heaven

    Shall be her children

    Then darling rest upon my breast
    And teach my heart to lean

    With thy sweet trust upon the arm
    Which folds us both unseen



    THE ROCK IN EL GHOR

    Dead Petra in her hilltomb sleeps
    Her stones of emptiness remain

    Around her sculptured mystery sweeps
    s plain

    From the doomed dwellers in the cleft
    The bow of vengeance turns not back

    Of all her myriads none are left
    Along the Wady Mousa

    Clear in the hot Arabian day

    Her arches spring her statues climb
    Unchanged the graven wonders pay

    No tribute to the spoiler Time

    Unchanged the awful lithograph
    Of power and glory vmdertrod

    Of nations scattered like the cliaft

    Blown from the threshingfloor of God

    Yet shall the thoughtful stranger turn
    From Petra

    To mark afar the burial urn
    Of Aaron on the cliffs of Hor

    And where upon its ancient guard

    Thy Rock El Ghor is standing yet

    Looks from its turrets desertward

    And keeps the watch that God has set

    The same as when in thunders loud
    It heard the voice of God to man

    As when it saw in fire and cloud
    s van

    Or when from EzionGeber
    It saw the long procession file

    And heard the Hebrew timbrels play
    The music of the lordly Nile

    While Moses graved the sacred laws

    Rock of the desert prophetsung

    How grew its shadowing pile at length
    A symbol in the Hebrew tongue

    Of God

    On lip of bard and scroll of seer

    From age to age went down the name

    Until the Shilohs promised year

    And Christ the Rock of Ages came

    The path of life we walk today

    Is strange as that the Hebrews trod

    We need the shadowing rock as they
    We need like them the guides of God

    THE OVERHEART

    For of Him and through Him and to Him are all
    things  to whom be glory forever I  Romans xi 3C

    Above below in sky and sod

    In leaf and spar in star and man
    Well might the wise Athenian scan

    The geometric signs of God

    The measured order of His plan

    And Indias mystics sang aright
    Of the One Life pervading all
    One Being

    In soul and form in sound and sight
    Eternal outflow and recall

    God is  and man in guilt and fear
    The central fact of Nature owns
    Kneels trembling by his altar stones

    And darkly dreams the ghastly smear
    Of blood appeases and atones

    Guilt shapes the Terror  deep within
    The human heart the secret lies
    Of all the hideous deities

    And painted on a ground of sin
    The fabled gods of torment rise



    And what is He  The ripe grain nods
    The sweet dews fall the sweet flowers

    blow
    But darker signs His presence show

    s
    And good and evil interflow

    O hearts of love  O souls that turn
    Like sunflowers to the pure and best
    To you the truth is manifest

    For they the mind of Christ discern
    Who lean like John upon His breast

    In him of whom the sibyl told

    For whom the prophet
    Whose need the sage and magian owned

    The loving heart of God behold

    The hope for which the ages groaned

    Fade pomp of dreadful imagery
    Wherewith mankind have deified
    Their hate and selfishness and pride

    Let the scared dreamer wake to see
    The Christ of Nazareth at his side

    What doth that holy Guide require
    No rite of pain nor gift of blood
    But man a kindly brotherhood

    Looking where duty is desire
    To Him the beautiful and good

    Gone be the faithlessness of fear

    s sweet rain
    Wash out the altar

    The law of Hatred disappear
    The law of Love alone remain

    How fall the idols false and grim
    And lo  their hideous wreck above
    The emblems of the Lamb and Dove

    Man turns from God not God from him
    And guilt in suflering whispers Love

    The world sits at the feet of Christ
    Unknowing blind and unconsoled
    It yet shall touch His garment

    And feel the heavenly Alchemist
    Transform its very dust to gold

    The theme befitting angel tongues
    Beyond a mortals scope has grown
    O heart of mine  with reverence own

    The fulness which to it belongs

    And trust the unknown for the known

    And I sought whence is Evil  I set before the eye

    therein  sea earth air stars trees moral creatures

    yea whatsoever there is we do not see  angels and
    spiritual powers Where is evil and whence comes it
    since God the Good hath created all things  Why
    made He anything at all of evil and not rather by His
    Almightiness cause it not to be  These thoughts I
    turned in my miserable heart overcharged vvitli most
    gnawing cares  And admonished to return to my
    self I entered even into my inmost soul Thou being
    my guide and beheld even beyond my soul and mind
    the Light unchangeable He who knows tlie Truth
    knows what that Light is and he that knows it knows
    Eternity  O Truth who art Eternity  Love who art
    Truth  Eternity who art Love  And I beheld that
    Thou madest all things good and to Thee is nothing
    whatsoever evil From the angel to the worm from
    the first motion to the last Thou settest each in its
    place and everything is good in its kind Woe is me

    The fourteen centuries fall away
    Between us and the Afric saint
    And at his side we urge today
    The immemorial quest and old complaint

    No outward sign to us is given

    From sea or earth comes no reply

    Hushed as the warm Numidian heaven

    He vainly questioned bends our frozen sky

    No victory comes of all our strife

    From all we grasp the meaning slips
    The Sphinx sits at the gate of life
    With the old question on her awful lips

    In paths unknown we hear the feet
    Of fear before and guilt behind
    We pluck the wayside fruit and eat
    Ashes and dust beneath its golden rind

    From age to age descends michecked

    The sad bequest of sire to son
    The bodys taint the mind
    Through eveiy web of life the dark threads
    run

    Oh why and whither  God knows all

    I only know that He is good
    And that whatever may befall
    Or here or there must be the best that
    could

    Between the dreadful cherubim
    A Father



    As Moses looked of old on Him
    And saw His glory into goodness turn

    For He is merciful as just

    And so by faith correcting sight
    I bow before His will and trust
    Howeer they seem He doeth all things
    right

    And dare to hope that He will make

    The rugged smooth the doubtful plain
    His mercy never quite forsake
    His healing visit every realm of pain

    That suffering is not His revenge

    Upon His creatures weak and frail
    Sent on a pathway new and strange
    With feet that wander and with eyes that
    fail

    That o

    Watches the tender eye of Love
    The slow transmuting of the chain
    Whose links are iron below to gold above

    Ah me  we doubt the shining skies

    Seen through our shadows of offence
    And drown with our poor childish cries
    The cradlehymn of kindly Providence

    And still we love the evil cause

    And of the just effect complain
    We tread upon lifes broken laws
    And murmur at our selfinflicted pain

    We turn us from the light and find

    Our spectral shapes before us thrown
    As they who leave the sim behind
    Walk in the shadows of themselves alone

    And scarce by will or strength of ours

    We set our faces to the day
    Weak wavering blind the Eternal
    Powers
    Alone can turn iis from ourselves away

    Our weakness is the strength of sin

    But love must needs be stronger far
    Outreaching all and gathering in
    The erring spirit and the wandering star

    A Voice grows with the growing years

    Earth hushing down her bitter cry
    Looks upward from her graves and hears
    The Resurrection and the Life am I

    THE CRY OF A LOST SOUL

    Lieutenant Herndons Report of the Explo
    ration of the Amazon has a striking description
    of the peculiar and melancholy notes of a bird
    heard by night on the shores of the river The
    Indian guides called it
    Soul   Among the numerous translations of
    this poem is one by the Emperor of Brazil

    In that black forest where when day is

    done
    With a snake
    Darkly from sunset to the rising sun



    A cry as of the pained heart of the wood
    The long despairing moan of solitude
    And darkness and the absence of all good

    Startles the traveller with a sound so drear
    So full of hopeless agony and fear
    His heart stands still and listens like his
    ear

    The guide as if he heard a deadbell toll
    s

    thole
    Crosses himself and whispers

    soul

    No SeKor not a bird I know it well
    It is the pained soul of some infidel
    Or cuised heretic that cries from hell

    Poor fool  with hope still mocking his

    despair
    He wanders shrieking on the midnight

    air
    For human pity and for Christian prayer

    Saints strike him dumb  Our Holy Mo
    ther hath
    No prayer for him who sinning unto death
    Burns always in the furnace of Gods
    wrath

    Thus to the baptized pagan
    Lending new horror to that mournful cry
    The voyager listens making no reply

    Dim burns the boatlamp  shadows deepen

    round
    From giant trees with snakelike creepers

    wound
    And the black water glides without a sound

    But in the travellers heart a secret sense
    Of nature plastic to benign intents
    And an eternal good in Providence

    Lifts to the starry calm of heaven his

    eyes
    And lo  rebuking all earth
    The Cross of pardon lights the tropic

    skies

    Father of all   be urges his strong plea
    Thou lovest all  Thy erring child may

    be
    Lost to himself but never lost to Thee



    ANDREW RYKMANS PRAYER



    439



    All soiils are Thine  the wings of morn
    ing bear

    None from that Presence which is every
    where

    Nor hell itself can hide for Thou art there

    Through sins of sense perversities of will
    Through doubt and pain through guilt and

    shame and ill
    Thy pitying eye is on Thy creature still

    Wilt thou not make Eternal Source and

    Goal
    In Thy long years lifes broken circle whole
    And change to praise the cry of a lost soul



    ANDREW RYKMAN

    Andrew Rykman s dead and gone

    You can see his leaning slate
    In the graveyard and thereon

    Read his name and date

    Trust is truer than our fears

    Runs the legend through the moss

    Gain is not in added years
    Nor in death is loss

    Still the feet that thither trod
    All the friendly eyes are dim

    Only Nature now and God
    Have a care for him

    There the dews of quiet fall

    Singing birds and soft winds stray

    Shall the tender Heart of all
    Be less kind than they

    What he was and what he is
    They who ask may haply find

    If they read this prayer of his
    Which he left behind



    Pardon Lord the lips that dare
    Shape in words a mortal
    Prayer that when my day is done
    And I see its setting sun
    Shorn and beamless cold and dim
    s rim
    When this ball of rock and clay
    Crumbles from my feet away
    And the solid shores of sense



    Melt into the vague immense
    Father  I may come to Thee
    Even with the beggar
    As the poorest of Thy poor
    With my needs and nothing more

    Not as one who seeks his home

    With a step assured I come

    Still behind the tread I hear

    Of my lifecompanion Fear

    Still a shadow deep and vast

    From my westering feet is cast

    Wavering doubtful undefined

    Never shapen nor outlined

    From myself the fear has grown

    And the shadow is my own

    Yet O Lord through all a sense

    Of Thy tender providence

    Stays my failing heart on Thee

    And confirms the feeble knee

    And at times my worn feet press

    Spaces of cool quietness

    Lilied whiteness shone upon

    Not by light of moon or sun

    Hours there be of inmost calm

    Broken but by grateful psalm

    When I love Thee more than fear Thee

    And Thy blessed Christ seems near me

    With forgiving look as when

    He beheld the INIagdalen

    Well I know that all thuigs move

    To the spheral rhythm of love

    That to Thee O Lord of all

    Nothing can of chance befall

    Child and seraph mote and star

    Well Thou knowest what we are

    Through Thy vast creative plan

    Looking from the worm to man

    There is pity in Thine ees

    But no hatred nor surprise

    Not in blind caprice of will

    Not in cunning sleight of skill

    Not for show of power was wrought

    Natures marvel in Thy thought

    Never careless hand and vain

    Smites these chords of joy and pain

    No immortal selfishness

    Plays the game of curse and bless

    Heaven and earth are witnesses

    That Thy glory goodness is

    Not for sport of mind and force

    Hast Thou made Thy universe

    But as atmosphere and zone

    Of Thy loving heart alone

    Man who walketh in a show

    All things flow and fluctuate
    Now contract and now dilate
    In the welter of this sea
    Nothing stable is but Thee
    In this whirl of swooning trance
    Thou alone art permanence
    All without Thee only seems
    All beside is choice of dreams
    Never yet in darkest mood
    Doubted I that Thou wast good
    Nor mistook my will for fate
    Pain of sin for heavenly hate
    Never dreamed the gates of pearl
    Rise from out the burning marl
    Or that good can only live
    Of the bad conservative
    And through counterpoise of hell
    Heaven alone be possible

    For myself alone I doubt

    All is well I know without

    I alone the beauty mar

    I alone the music jar

    Yet with hands by evil stained

    And an ear by discord pained

    I am groping for the keys

    Of the heavenly harmonies

    Still within my heart I bear

    Love for all things good and fair

    Hands of want or souls in pain

    Have not sought my door in vain

    I have kept my fealty good

    To the human brotherhood

    Scarcely have I asked in prayer

    That which others might not share

    I who hear with secret shame

    Praise that paineth more than blame

    Rich alone in favors lent

    Virtuous by accident

    Doubtful where I fain would rest

    Frailest where I seem the best

    Only strong for lack of test

    What am I that I should press

    Special pleas of selfislmess

    Coolly mounting into heaven

    On my neighbor unforgiven

    Neer to me howeer disguised

    Comes a saint unrecognized

    Never fails my heart to greet

    Noble deed with warmer beat

    Halt and maimed I own not less

    All the grace of holiness

    Nor through shame or selfdistrust



    Less I love the pure and just
    Lord forgive these words of mine
    What have I that is not Thine
    Whatsoe
    Needs Thy pitying pardon most
    Thou O Elder Brother  who
    In Thy flesh our trial knew
    Thou who hast been touched by these
    Our most sad infirmities
    Thou alone the gulf canst span
    In the dual heart of man
    And between the soul and sense
    Reconcile all difterence
    Change the dream of me and mine
    For the truth of Thee and Thine
    And through chaos doubt and strife
    Interfuse Thy calm of life
    Haply thus by Thee renewed
    In Thy borrowed goodness good
    Some sweet morning yet in God
    Dim jeouian periods
    Joyful I shall wake to see
    Those I love who rest in Thee
    And to them in Thee allied
    Shall my soul be satisfied

    Scarcely Hope hath shaped for me
    What the future life may be
    Other lips may well be bold
    Like the publican of old
    I can only urge the plea
    Lord be merciful to me
    Nothing of desert I claim
    Unto me belongeth shame
    Not for me the crowns of gold
    Palms and harpings manifold
    Not for erring eye and feet
    Jasper wall and golden street
    What thou wilt O Father give
    All is gain that I receive
    If my voice I may not raise
    In the elders song of praise
    If I may not sindefiled
    Claim my birthright as a child
    SiLffer it that I to Thee
    As an hired servant be
    Let the lowliest task be mine
    Grateful so the work be Thine
    Let me find the humblest place
    In the shadow of Thy grace
    Blest to me were any spot
    Where temptation whispers not
    If there be some weaker one
    Give me strength to help him on
    If a blinder soul there be



    THE ANSWER



    441



    Let me guide him nearer Thee
    Make my mortal dreams come true
    With the work I fain woukl do
    Clothe with life the weak intent
    Let me be the thing I meant
    Let me find in Thy employ
    Peace that dearer is than joy
    Out of self to love be led
    And to heaven acclimated
    Until all things sweet and good
    Seem my natural habitude



    So we read the prayer of him
    Who with John of Labadie

    Trod of old the oozy rim
    Of the Zuyder Zee

    Thus did Andrew Rykman pray

    Are we wiser better grown
    That we may not in our day

    Make his prayer our own



    THE ANSWER

    Spare me dread angel of reproof
    And let the sunshine weave today

    Its goldthreads in the warp and woof
    Of life so poor and gray

    Spare me awhile  the flesh is weak

    These lingering feet that fain would stray
    Among the flowers shall some day seek

    The strait and narrow way

    Take off thy everwatchful eye
    The awe of thy rebuking frown

    The dullest slave at times must sigh
    To fling his burdens down

    To drop his galley

    And press in summer warmth and calm

    The lap of some enchanted shore
    Of blossom and of balm

    Grudge not my life its hour of bloom
    My heart its taste of long desire

    This day be mine  be those to come
    As duty shall require

    The deep voice answered to my own
    Smiting my selfish prayers away



    Tomorrow is with God alone
    And man hath but today

    Say not thy fond vain heart within
    The Fathers arm shall still be wide

    When from these pleasant ways of sin
    Thou turn

    Cast thyself down
    And angels shall thy feet upbear

    He bids thee make a lie of faith

    And blasphemy of prayer

    Though God be good and free be heaven
    No force divine can love compel

    And though the song of sins forgiven
    May sound through lowest hell

    The sweet persuasion of His voice

    Respects thy sanctity of will
    He givetli day  thou hast thy choice

    To walk in darkness still

    As one who turning from the light
    Watches his own gray shadow fall

    Doubting upon his path of night
    If there be day at all

    No word of doom may shut thee out
    No wind of wrath may downward whirl

    No swords of fire keep watch about
    The open gates of pearl

    A tenderer light than moon or sun
    Than song of earth a sweeter hymn

    May shine and sound forever on
    And thou be deaf and dim

    Forever round the Mercyseat

    The guiding lights of Love shall burn

    But what if habitboimd thy feet
    Shall lack the will to turn

    What if tliine eye refuse to see

    Thine ear of Heavens free welcome
    fail

    And thou a willing captive be
    Thyself thy own dark jail

    Oh doom beyond the saddest guess
    As the long years of God unroll

    To make thy dreary selfishness
    The prison of a soul

    To doubt the love that fain would break

    THE ETERNAL GOODNESS

    FRIKNDS  with whom my feet have trod
    The quiet aisles of prayer

    Glad witness to your zeal for God
    And love of man I bear

    1 trace your lines of argument

    Your logic linked and strong

    I weigh as one who dreads dissent

    And fears a doubt as wrong

    But still my human hands are weak

    To hold your iron creeds
    Against the words ye bid me speak

    My heart within me pleads

    Who fathoms the Eternal Thought

    Who talks of scheme and plan
    The Lord is God  He needeth not

    The poor device of man

    I walk with bare hushed feet the ground
    Ye tread with boldness shod

    I dare not fix with mete and bound
    The love and power of God

    Ye praise His justice  even such

    His pitying love I deem
    Ye seek a king  I fain would touch

    The robe that hath no seam

    Ye see the curse which overbroods

    A world of pain and loss
    I hear our Lords beatitudes

    And prayer upon the cross

    More than your schoolmen teach within

    Myself alas  I know
    Too dark ye cannot paint the sin

    Too small the merit show

    I bow my forehead to the dust

    I veil mine eyes for shame
    And urge in trembling selfdistrust

    A prayer without a claim

    I see the wrong that round me lies
    I feel the guilt within



    I hear with groan and travailcries
    The world confess its sin

    Yet in the maddeniug maze of things
    And tossed by storm and flood

    To one fixed trust my spirit clings
    I know that God is good

    Not mine to look where cherubim

    And seraphs may not see
    But nothing can be good in Him

    Which evil is in me

    The wrong that pains my soul below

    I dare not throne above
    I know not of His hate  I know

    His goodness and His love

    I dimly guess from blessings known

    Of greater out of sight
    And with the chastened Psalmist own

    His judgments too are right

    I long for household voices gone
    For vanished smiles I long

    But God hath led my dear ones on
    And He can do no wrong

    I know not what the future hath

    Of marvel or surprise
    Assured alone that life and death

    His mercy underlies

    And if my heart and flesh are weak

    To bear an untried pain
    The bruised reed He will not break

    But strengthen and sustain

    No offering of my own I have
    Nor works my faith to prove

    I can but give the gifts He gave
    And plead His love for love

    And so beside the Silent Sea

    I wait the muffled oar
    No harm from Him can come to me

    On ocean or on shore

    I know not where His islands lift
    Their fronded palms in air

    I only know I cannot drift
    Beyond His love and care

    O brothers  if my faith is vain
    If hopes like these betray

    THE COMMON QUESTION

    Behind us at our evening meal

    The gray bird ate his fill
    Swung downward by a single claW

    And wiped his hooked bill

    He shook his wings and crimson tail

    And set his head aslant
    And in his sharp impatient way

    Asked What does Charlie want

    Fie silly bird   I answered  tuck
    Your liead beneath your wing

    And go to sleep
    He asked the selfsame thing

    Then smiling to myself I said

    How like are men and birds
    We all are saying what he says

    In action or in words

    The boy with whip and top and drum

    The girl with hoop and doll
    And men with lands and houses ask

    The question of Poor Poll

    However full with something more

    We fain the bag would cram
    We sigh above our crowded nets

    For fish that never swam

    No bounty of indulgent Heaven

    The vague desire can stay
    Selflove is still a Tartar mill

    For grinding prayers alway

    The dear God hears and pities all

    He knoweth all our wants
    And what we blindly ask of Him

    His love withholds or grants

    And so I sometimes think our prajers
    Might well be merged in one

    And nest and perch and heartli and church
    Repeat  Thy will be done



    OUR MASTER

    Immortal Love forever full

    Forever flowing free
    Forever shared forever whole

    A neverebbing sea

    Our outward lips confess the name

    All other names above
    Love only knoweth whence it came

    And comprehendeth love

    Blow winds of God awake and blow

    The mists of earth away
    Shine out O Light Divine and show

    How wide and far we stray

    Hush every lip close evexy book
    The strife of tongues forbear

    Why forward reach or backward look
    For love that clasps like air

    We may not climb the heavenly steeps
    To bring the Lord Christ dovn

    In vain we search the lowest deeps
    For Him no depths can drown

    Nor holy bread nor blood of grape

    The lineaments restore
    Of Him we know in outward shape

    And in the flesh no more

    He Cometh not a king to reign

    The worlds long hojie is dim
    The weary centuries watch in vain

    The clouds of heaven for Him

    Death comes life goes  the asking eye

    And ear are answerless
    The grave is dumb the hollow sky

    Is sad with silentuess

    The letter fails and systems fall

    And every symbol wanes
    The Spirit overbrooding all

    Eternal Love remains

    And not for signs in heaven above

    Or earth below they look
    Who know with John His smile of love

    With Peter His rebuke

    In joy of inward peace or sense
    Of sorrow over sin

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    He is His owu best evidence
    His witness is within

    No fable old nor mythic lore

    Nor dream of bards and seers
    No dead fact stranded on the shore

    Of the oblivious years

    But warm sweet tender even yet

    A present help is He
    And faith has still its Olivet

    And love its Galilee

    The healing of His seamless dress

    Is by our beds of pain
    We touch Him in lifes throng and press

    And we are whole again

    Through Him the first fond prayers are said

    Our lips of childhood frame
    The last low whispers of our dead

    Are burdened with His name

    Our Lord and Master of us all

    Whateer our name or sign
    We own Thy sway we hear Thy call

    We test our lives by Thine

    Thou judgest us  Thy purity

    Doth all our lusts condemn
    The love that draws us nearer Thee

    Is hot with wrath to them

    Our thoughts lie open to Thy sight

    And naked to Thy glance
    Our secret sins are in tlie light

    Of Thy pure countenance

    Thy healing pains a keen distress

    Thy tender light shines in
    Thy sweetness is the bitterness

    Thy grace the pang of sin

    Yet weak and blinded though we be

    Thou dost our service own
    We bring our varying gifts to Thee

    And Thou rejectest none

    To Thee our full humanity

    Its joys and pains belong
    The wrong of man to man on Thee

    Inflicts a deeper wrong

    Who hates hates Thee who loves becomes
    Therein to Thee allied



    All sweet accords of hearts and homes
    In Thee are multiplied

    Deep strike Thy roots O heavenly Vine

    Within our earthly sod
    Most human and yet most divine

    The flower of man and God

    O Love  O Life  Our faith and sight

    Thy presence maketh one
    As through transfigured clouds of white

    We trace the noonday sun

    So to our mortal eyes subdued
    Fleshveiled but not concealed

    AVe know in Thee the fatherhood
    And heart of God revealed

    We faintly hear we dimly see
    In differing phrase we pray

    But dim or clear we own in Thee
    The Light the Truth the Way

    The homage that we render Thee

    Is still our Fathers own
    No jealous claim or rivalry

    Divides the Cross and Throne

    To do Thy will is more than praise
    As words are less than deeds

    And simple trust can find Thy ways
    We miss with chart of creeds

    No pride of self Thy service hath

    No place for me and mine
    Our human strength is weakness death

    Our life apart from Thine

    Apart from Thee all gain is loss

    All labor vainly done
    The solemn shadow of Thy Cross

    Is better thau the sun

    Alone O Love ineffable

    Thy saving name is given
    To turn aside from Thee is hell

    To walk with Thee is heaven

    How vain secure in all Thou art

    Our noisy championship
    The sighing of the contrite heart

    Is more than flattering lip

    Not Thine the bigots partial plea
    Nor Thine the zealots ban

    445



    Thou well canst spare a love of Thee
    Which ends in hate of man

    Our Friend our Brother and our Lord
    What may Thy service be

    Nor name nor form nor ritual word
    But simply following Thee

    We bring no ghastly holocaust

    We pile no graven stone
    He serves thee best who loveth most

    His brothers and Thy own

    Thy litanies sweet offices

    Of love and gratitude
    Thy sacramental liturgies

    Tlie joy of doing good

    In vain shall waves of incense drift

    The vaulted nive around
    In vain the minster turret lift

    Its brazen weights of sound

    The heart must ring Thy Christmas bells

    Thy inward altars raise
    Its faith and hope Thy canticles

    And its obedience praise



    THE MEETING

    The two speakers in the meeting referred
    to in this poem were Avis Keene whose very
    presence was a benediction a woman lovely in
    spirit and person whose words seemed a mes
    sage of love and tender concern to her hearers
    and Sibyl Jones whose inspired eloquence and
    rare spirituality impressed all who knew her
    In obedience to her apprehended duty she
    made nsits of Christian love to various parts
    of Eiuope and to the West Coast of Africa and
    Palestine

    The elder folks shook hands at last

    Down seat by seat the signal passed

    To simple ways like ours unused

    Half solemnized and half amused

    With longdrawn breath and shrug my

    guest
    His sense of glad relief expressed
    Outside the hills lay warm in sun
    The cattle in the meadowrun
    Stood halfleg deep  a single bird
    The green repose above us stirred
    What part or lot have you
    In these dull rites of drowsvhead



    Is silence worship  Seek it where

    It soothes with dreams the summer air

    Not in this close and rudebenched hall

    But where soft lights and shadows fall

    And all the slow sleepwalking hours

    Glide soundless over grass and flowers

    From time and place and form apart

    Its holy ground the human heart

    Nor ritualbound nor templeward

    Walks the free spirit of the Lord

    Our common Master did not pen

    His followers up from otlier men

    His service liberty indeed

    He built no church He framed no creed

    But while the saintly Pharisee

    Made broader his phylactery

    As from the synagogue was seen

    The dustysandalled Nazarene

    Through ripening cornfields lead the way

    Upon the awful Sabbath day

    His sermons were the healthfid talk

    That shorter made the mountainwalk

    His wayside texts were flowers and birds

    Where mingled with His gracious words

    The rustle of the tamarisktree

    And ripplewash of Galilee

    I said

    Unmeasured and unlimited

    With noiseless slide of stone to stone

    The mystic Church of God has grown

    Invisible arid silent stands

    The temple never made with hands

    Unheard the voices still and small

    Of its unseen confessional

    He needs no special place of prayer

    Whose hearing ear is everywhere

    He brings not back the childish days

    That ringed the earth with stones of praise

    Roofed Karnaks hall of gods and laid

    The plinths of Philes colonnade

    Still less He owns the selfish good

    And sickly growth of solitude

    The worthless grace that out of sight

    Flowers in the desert anchorite

    Dissevered from the suffering whole

    Love hath no power to save a soul

    Not out of Self the origin

    And native air and soil of sin

    The living waters spring and flow

    The trees with leaves of healing grow

    Dream not O friend because I seek
    This quiet shelter twice a week
    I better deem its pinelaid floor

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Than breezy hill or seasung shore

    But nature is not solitude

    She crowds us with her thronging wood

    Her many hands reach out to us

    Her many tongues are garrulous

    Perpetual riddles of suiprise

    She offers to our ears and eyes

    She will not leave our senses still

    But drags them captive at her will

    And making earth too great for heaven

    She hides the Giver in the given

    And so I find it well to come

    For deeper rest to this still room

    For here the habit of the soul

    Feels less the outer worlds control

    The strength of mutual purpose pleads

    More earnestly our common needs

    And from the silence multiplied

    By these still forms on either side

    The world that time and sense have known

    Falls off and leaves us God alone

    Yet rarely through the charmed repose
    Unmixed the stream of motive flows
    A flavor of its many springs
    The tints of earth and sky it brings
    In the still waters needs must be
    Some shade of human sympathy
    And here in its accustomed place
    I look on memory
    The blind bysitter guesseth not
    What shadow haunts that vacant spot
    No eyes save mine alone can see
    The love wherewith it welcomes me
    And still with those alone my kin
    In doubt and weakness want and sin
    I bow my head my heart I bare
    As when that face was living there
    And strive too oft alas  in vain
    The peace of simple trust to gain
    Fold fancys restless wings and lay
    The idols of my heart away

    Welcome the silence all unbroken
    Nor less the words of fitness spoken
    Such golden words as hers for whom
    Our autumn flowers have just made room
    Whose hopeful utterance through and

    through
    The freshness of the morning blew
    Who loved not less the earth that light
    Fell on it from the heavens in sight
    But saw in all fair forms more fair
    The Eternal beauty mirrored there



    Whose eighty years but added grace

    And saintlier meaning to her face

    The look of one who bore away

    Glad tidings from the hills of day

    While all our hearts went forth to meet

    The coming of her beautiful feet

    Or haply hers whose pilgrim tread

    Is in the paths where Jesus led

    Who dreams her childhoods sabbath

    dream
    By Jordans willowshaded stream
    And of the hymns of hope and faith
    Sung by the monks of Nazareth
    Hears pious echoes in the call
    To prayer from Moslem minarets fall
    Repeating where His works were wrought
    The lesson that her Master taught
    Of whom an elder Sibyl gave
    The prophecies of Cumses cave

    I ask no organ

    To drone the themes of life and death

    No altar candlelit by day

    No ornate wordsmans rhetoricplay

    No cool philosophy to teach

    Its bland audacities of speech

    To doubletasked idolaters

    Themselves their gods and worsliippers

    No pulpit hammered by the fist

    Of loudasserting dogmatist

    Wlio borrows for the Hand of love

    The smoking thunderbolts of Jove

    I know how well the fathers taught

    What work the later schoolmen wrought

    I reverence oldtime faith and men

    But God is near us now as then

    His force of love is still unspent

    His hate of sin as imminent

    And still the measure of our needs

    Outgrows the cramping bounds of creeds

    The manna gathered yesterday

    Already savors of decay

    Doubts to the world

    Question us now from star and stone

    Too little or too much we know

    And sight is swift and faith is slow

    The power is lost to selfdeceive

    With shallow forms of makebelieve

    We walk at high noon and the bells

    Call to a thousand oracles

    But the sound deafens and the light

    Is stronger than our dazzled sight

    The letters of the sacred Book

    Glimmer and swim beneath our look

    s breast



    THE CLEAR VISION



    447



    With deepening agony of quest
    The old entreaty
    Or look we for the Christ to be

    God shoidd be most where man is least

    So where is neither church nor priest

    And never rag of form or creed

    To clothe the nakedness of need

    Where farmerfolk in silence meet

    I turn my bellunsummoned feet

    I lay the critics glass aside

    I tread upon my lettered pride

    And lowestseated testify

    To the oneness of humanity

    Confess the universal want

    And share whatever Heaven may grant

    He findeth not who seeks his own

    The sovd is lost that s saved alone

    Not on one favored forehead fell

    Of old the firetongued miracle

    But flamed oer all the thronging host

    The baptism of the Holy Ghost

    Heart answers heart  in one desire

    The blending lines of prayer aspire

    Where in my name meet two or three

    Our Lord liath said  I there will be

    So sometimes comes to soul and sense
    The feeling which is evidence
    That very near about us lies
    The realm of spiritual mysteries
    The sphere of the supernal powers
    Impinges on this world of ours
    The low and dark horizon lifts
    To light the scenic terror shifts
    The breath of a diviner air
    Blows down the answer of a prayer
    That all our sorrow pain and doubt
    A great compassion clasps about
    And law and goodness love and force
    Are wedded fast beyond divorce
    Then duty leaves to love its task
    The beggar Self forgets to ask
    With smile of trust and foldetl hands
    The passive soul in waiting stands
    To feel as flowers the sun and dew
    The One true Life its own renew

    So to the calmly gathered thought
    The innermost of truth is taught
    The mystery dimly understood
    That love of God is love of good
    And chiefly its divinest trace
    lu Him of Nazareths holy face



    That to be saved is only this

    Salvation from our selfishness

    From more than elemental fire

    The souls unsanctified desire

    From sin itself and not the pain

    That warns us of its chafing chain

    That worships deeper meaning lies

    In mercy and not sacrifice

    Not proud humilities of sense

    And posturing of penitence

    But loves unforced obedience

    That Book and Church and Day are given

    For man not God  for earth not

    heaven
    The blessed means to holiest ends
    Not masters but benignant friends
    That the dear Christ dwells not afar
    The king of some remoter star
    Listening at times with flattered ear
    To homage wrung from selfish fear
    But here amidst the poor and blind
    The bomid and suffering of our kind
    In works we do in prayers we pray
    Life of our life He lives today



    THE CLEAR VISION

    I DID but dream I never knew

    What charms our sternest season wore

    Was never yet the sky so blue
    Was never earth so white before

    Tdl now I never saw the glow

    Of sunset on yon hills of snow

    And never learned the bough

    Of beauty in its leafless lines

    Did ever such a morning break

    As that my eastern windows see
    Did ever such a moonlight take

    Weird photographs of shrub and tree
    Rang ever bells so wild and fleet
    The music of the winter street
    Was ever yet a sound by half
    s laugh

    O Earth  with gladness overfraught

    No added charm thy face hath found
    Within my heart the clumge is wrought
    My footsteps make enchanted ground
    From couch of pain and curtained room
    Forth to thy light and air I come
    To find in all that meets my eyes
    I The freshness of a glad surprise

    Fair seem these winter days and soon

    Shall blow the warm west winds of spring
    To set the unbound rills in tnne

    And hither urge the bluebird
    The vales shall laugh in flowers the woods
    Grow misty green with leafing buds
    And violets and windflowers sway
    Against the throbbing heart of May

    Break forth my lips in praise and own

    The wiser love severely kind
    Since richer for its chastening grown

    I see whereas I once was blind
    The world O Father  hath not wronged
    With loss the life by Thee prolonged
    But still with every added year
    More beautiful Thy works appear

    As Thou hast made thy world without

    Make Thou more fair my world within
    Shine through its lingering clouds of doubt

    Rebuke its haunting shapes of sin
    Fill brief or long my granted span
    Of life with love to thee and man
    Strike when thou wilt the hour of rest
    But let my last days be my best



    DIVINE COMPASSION

    Long since a dream of heaven I had
    And still the vision haunts me oft

    I see the saints in white robes clad
    The martyrs with their palms aloft

    But hearing still in middle song
    The ceaseless dissonance of wrong

    And shrinking with hid faces from the
    strain

    Of sad beseeching eyes full of remorse
    and pain

    The glad song falters to a wail
    The harping sinks to low lament

    Before the still unlifted veil

    I see the crowned foreheads bent

    Making more sweet the heavenly air
    With breathings of unselfish prayer

    And a Voice saith   O Pity which is pain

    O Love that weeps fill up my sufPerings
    which remain

    Shall souls redeemed by me refuse
    To share my sorrow in their turn

    Or sinforgiven my gift abuse
    Of peace with selfish unconcern



    Has saintly ease no pitying care

    Has faith no work and love no prayer

    While sin remains and souls in darkness
    dwell

    Can heaven itself be heaven and look un
    moved on hell

    Then through the Gates of Pain I dream
    A wind of heaven blows coolly in

    Fainter the awful discords seem

    The smoke of torment grows more thin

    Tears quench the burning soil and thence
    Spring sweet pale flowers of penitence

    s de
    spair

    Starcrowned an angel walks and lo  God
    hope is there

    Is it a dream  Is heaven so high
    That pity cannot breathe its air

    Its happy eyes forever dry
    Its holv lips without a prayer

    My God  my God  if thither led
    By Thy free grace unmerited

    No crown nor palm be mine but let me
    keep

    A heart that still can feel and eyes that still
    can weep



    THE PRAYERSEEKER

    Along the aisle where prayer was made
    A woman all in black arrayed
    Closeveiled between the kneeling host
    With gliding motion of a ghost
    Passed to the desk and laid thereon
    A scroll which bore these words alone
    Pray for me

    Back from the place of worshipping
    She glided like a guilty thing
    The rustle of her draperies stirred
    By hurrying feet alone was heard
    While full of awe the preacher read
    As out into the dark she sped
    Pray for me

    Back to the night from whence she came
    To unimagined grief or shame
    Across the threshold of that door
    None knew the burden that she bore
    Alone she left the written scroll
    The legend of a troubled soul
    Pray for me

    Some misery inarticulate
    Some secret sin some shrouded dread
    Some household sorrow all unsaid
    Pray for us

    Pass on  The type of all thou art
    Sad witness to the common heart
    With face in veil and seal on lip
    In mute and strange companionship
    Like thee we wander to and fro
    Dumbly imploring as we go
    Pray for us

    Ah who shall pray since he who pleads
    Our want perchance hath greater needs
    Yet they who make their loss the gain
    Of others shall not ask in vain
    And Heaven bends low to hear the prayer
    Of love from lips of selfdespair
    Pray for us

    In vain remorse and fear and hate
    Beat with bruised hands against a fate
    Whose walls of iron only move
    And open to the touch of love
    He only feels his burdens fall
    Who taught by suffering pities all
    Pray for us

    He prayeth best who leaves unguessed
    The mystery of another
    erflow
    Or heads are white thou need
    Enough to note by many a sign
    That every heart hath needs like thine
    Pray for us

    In joy of life or mortal pang

    All men to Soma prayed

    Sends down these matin psalms
    And still with wondering eyes we trace
    The simple prayers to Soma

    Each after age has striven
    By music incense vigils drear
    And trance to bring the skies more near

    Or lift men up to heaven

    Thy birthrightclaim of womanhood
    An inward loathing deep intense
    A shame that is half innocence
    Cast off the graveclothes of thy sin 1

    THE PRAYER OF AGASSIZ

    The island of Penikese in Buzzard
    given by Mr John Anderson to Agassiz for
    the uses of a summer school of natural liistory
    A large barn was cleared and improvised as a
    lectureroom Here on the first morning of
    the school all the company was gathered
    Agassiz had arranged no programme of ex
    ercises says Mrs Agassiz in Louis Agassiz
    his Life and CorresjMndence  trusting to the
    interest of the occasion to suggest what might
    best be said or done But as he looked upon
    his pupils gathered there to study nature with
    him by an inipidse as natural as it was un
    premeditated he called upon them to join in
    silently asking Gods blessing on their work
    together The pause was broken by the first
    words of an address no less fervent than its un
    spoken prelude
    1873 and Agassiz died the December following

    On the isle of Penikese
    Ringed about by sapphire seas
    Fanned by breezes salt and cool
    Stood the Master with his school
    Over sails that not in vain
    Wooed the westwinds steady strain
    Line of coast that low and far
    Stretched its undulating bar
    Wings aslant across the rim
    Of the waves they stooped to skim
    Rock and isle and glistening bay
    Fell the beautiful white day

    Said the Master to the youth
    We have come in search of truth
    Trying with uncertain key
    Door by door of mystery
    We are reaching through His laws
    To the garmenthem of Cause
    Him the endless unbegun
    The Unnamable the O
    Light of all our light the Source
    Life of life and Force of force



    IN QUEST 451



    As with fingers of the blind

    We are groping here to find

    What the hieroglyphics mean

    Of the Unseen in the seen

    What the Thought which underlies

    Natures masking and disguise

    Wliat it is that hides beneath

    Blight and bloom and birth and death

    Bj past efforts unavailing

    Doubt and error loss and failing

    Of our weakness made aware

    On the threshold of our task

    Let us light and guidance ask

    Let us pause in silent prayer

    Then the Master in his place
    Bowed his head a little space
    And the leaves by soft airs stirred
    Lapse of wave and cry of bird
    Left the solemn hush imbroken
    Of that wordless prayer unspoken
    While its wish on earth unsaid
    Rose to heaven interpreted
    As in lifes best hours we hear
    By the spirits finer ear
    His low voice within us thus
    The AllFather lieareth us
    And His holy ear we pain
    With our noisy words and vain
    Not for Him our violence
    Storming at the gates of sense
    His the primal language His
    The eternal silences

    Even the careless heart was moved

    And the doubting gave assent

    With a gesture reverent

    To the Master wellbeloved

    As thin mists are glorified

    By the light they cannot hide

    All who gazed upon him saw

    Through its veil of tender awe

    How his face was still uplit

    By the old sweet look of it

    Hopeful trustful full of cheer

    And the love that casts out fear

    Who the secret may declare

    Of that brief unuttered prayer

    Did the shade before him come

    Of th inevitable doom

    Of the end of earth so near

    And Eternitys new year

    In the lap of sheltering seas
    Rests the isle of Penikese



    But the lord of the domain
    Comes not to his own again
    Where the eyes that follow fail
    On a vaster sea his sail
    Drifts beyond our beck and hail
    Other lips within its bound
    Shall the laws of life expound
    Other eyes from rock and shell
    Read the worlds old riddles well
    But when breezes light and bland
    Blow from Summers blossomed land
    When the air is glad with wings
    And the blithe songsparrow sings
    Many an eye with his still face
    Shall the living ones displace
    Many an ear the word shall seek
    He alone could fitly speak
    And one name forevermore
    Sliall be uttered oer and oer
    By the waves that kiss the shore
    By the ciirlews whistle sent
    Down the cool seascented air
    In all voices known to her
    Nature owns her worshipper
    Half in triumph half lament
    Thither Love shall tearful turn
    Friendship pause uncovered there
    And the wisest reverence learn
    From the Masters silent prayer



    IN QUEST

    Have I not voyaged friend beloved with

    thee
    On the great waters of the unsounded sea
    Momently listening with suspended oar
    For the low rote of waves upon a shore
    Changeless as heaven where never fog
    cloud drifts
    Over its windless wood nor mirage lifts
    The steadfast hills  where never birds of

    doubt
    Sing to mislead and every dream dies out
    And the dark riddles which perplex us

    here
    In the sharp solvent of its light are clear
    Thou knowest how vain our quest  how

    soon or late
    The baffling tides and circles of debate
    Swept back our bark unto its starting
    place
    Where looking forth upon the blank gray

    space
    And round about us seeing with sad eyes

    Can separate tables of the law be given
    No ride can bind which He himself denies
    The truths of time are not eternal lies

    So heard I  and the chaos round me spread
    To light and order grew  and  Lord I

    said
    Our sins are our tormentors worst of all
    Felt in distrustful shame that dares not call
    Upon Thee as our Father We have set
    A strange god up but Thou remainest yet
    All that I feel of pity Thou hast known
    Before I was  my best is all Thy own
    From Thy great heart of goodness mine but

    drew



    Wishes and prayers  but Thou O Lord

    wilt do
    In Thy own time by ways I cannot see
    All that I feel when I am nearest Thee



    THE FRIENDS BURIAL

    My thoughts are all in yonder town
    Where wept hj many tears

    Today my mother
    The burden of her years

    True as in life no poor disguise

    Of death with her is seen
    And on her simple casket lies

    No wreatli of bloom and green

    s art
    The mocking weeds of woe

    Dear memories in each mourner
    Like heavens white lilies blow

    And all about the softening air
    Of newborn sweetness tells

    And the ungathered Mayflowers wear
    The tints of ocean shells

    The old assuring miracle

    Is fresh as heretofore
    And earth takes up its parable

    Of life from death once more

    Here organswell and churchbell toll
    Methinks but discord were

    The prayerful silence of the soul
    Is best befitting her

    No sound should break the quietude

    Alike of earth and sky
    O wandering wind in Seabrook wood

    Breathe but a halfheard sigh

    Sing softly springbird for her sake

    And thou not distant sea
    Lapse lightly as if Jesus spake

    And thou wert Galilee

    For all her quiet life flowed on
    As meadow streamlets flow

    Wheie fresher green reveals alone
    The noiseless ways they go

    From her loved place of prayer I see
    The plainrobed mourners pass



    A CHRISTMAS CARMEN



    453



    With slow feet treacling reverently
    The graveyard

    Make room O mourning ones for me
    Where like the friends of Paul

    That you no more her face shall see
    You sorrow most of all

    Her path shall brighten more and more

    Unto the perfect day
    She cannot fail of peace who bore

    Such peace with her away

    O sweet calm face that seemed to wear

    The look of sins forgiven
    O voice of prayer that seemed to bear

    Our own needs up to heaven

    How reverent in our midst she stood

    Or knelt in grateful praise
    What grace of Christian womanhood

    Was in her household ways

    For still her holy living meant

    No duty left undone
    The heavenly and the human blent

    Their kindred loves in one

    And if her life small leisure found

    For feasting ear and eye
    And Pleasure on her daily round

    She passed impausing by

    Yet with her went a secret sense

    Of all things sweet and fair
    And Beautys gracious providence

    Refreshed her unaware

    She kept her line of rectitude
    With love

    Her kindly instincts understood
    All gentle courtesies

    An inborn charm of graciousness
    Made sweet her smile and tone

    And glorified her farmwife dress
    With beauty not its own

    The dear Lords best interpreters

    Are humble Iniman souls
    The Gospel of a life like hers

    Is more than books or scrolls

    From scheme and creed the light goes out
    The saintly fact survives



    The blessed Master none can doubt
    Revealed in holy lives

    A CHRISTMAS CARMEN



    Sound over all waters reach out from all

    lands
    The chorus of voices the clasping of hands
    Sing hymns that were sung by the stars of

    the morn
    Sing songs of the angels when Jesus was
    born
    With glad jubilations
    Bring hope to the nations
    The dark night is ending and dawn has be

    All speech flow to music all hearts beat

    love

    Sing out the warvulture and sing in the
    dove

    Till the hearts of the peoples keep time in
    accord

    And the voice of the world is the voice of
    the Lord
    Clasp hands of the nations
    In strong gratulations

    The dark night is ending and dawn has be

    Blow bugles of battle the marches of
    peace

    East west north and south let the long
    quarrel cease

    Sing the song of great joy that the angels
    began

    Sing of glory to God and of goodwill to
    man
    Hark  joining in chorus
    The heavens bend o

    The dark night is ending and dawn has be

    O Christ of God  whose life and death

    Our own have reconciled
    Most quietly most tenderly

    Take home Thy starnamed child

    Thy grace is in her patient eyes
    Thy words are on her tongue

    The very silence round her seems
    As if the angels sung

    s

    Who hears its mother call
    The lilies of Thy perfect peace

    About her pillow fall

    She leans from out our clinging arms

    To rest herself in Thine
    Alone to Thee dear Lord can we

    Our wellbeloved resign

    Oh less for her than for ourselves
    We bow our heads and pray

    Her setting star like Bethlehem
    To Thee shall point the way



    CHILDSONGS

    Still linger in our noon of time

    And on our Saxon tongue
    The echoes of the homeborn hymns

    The Aryan mothers sung

    And childhood had its litanies

    In every age and clime
    The earliest cradles of the race

    Were rocked to poets rhyme

    Nor sky nor wave nor tree nor flower
    Nor green earth

    So moved the singers heart of old
    As these small ones of God

    The mystery of unfolding life
    Was more than dawning morn

    Than opening flower or crescent moon
    The human soul newborn

    And still to childhood

    The heart of genius turns
    And more than all the sages teach

    From lisping voices learns



    The voices loved of him who sang
    Where Tweed and Teviot glide

    That sound today on all the winds
    That blow from Rydalside

    Heard in the Teutons household songs

    And folklore of the Finn
    Where

    The Christchild enters in

    Before lifes sweetest mystery stiU
    The heart in reverence kneels

    The wonder of the primal birth
    The latest mother feels

    We need love

    As only weakness can
    God hath His small interpreters

    The child must teach the man

    We wander wide through evil years
    Our eyes of faith grow dim

    But he is freshest from His hands
    And nearest unto Him

    And haply pleading long with Him

    For sinsick hearts and cold
    The angels of our childhood still

    The Fathers face behold

    Of such the kingdom   Teach Thou us

    O Master most divine
    To feel the deep significance

    Of these wise words of Thine

    The haughty eye shall seek in vain

    What innocence beholds
    No cunning finds the key of heaven

    No strength its gate unfolds

    Alone to guilelessness and love

    That gate shall open fall
    The mind of pride is nothingness

    The childlike heart is all



    THE HEALER

    TO A YOUNG PHYSICIAN WITH DORE
    PICTURE OF CHRIST HEALING THE SICK

    So stood of old the holy Christ
    Amidst the suflering throng

    With whom His lightest touch sufficed
    To make the weakest strong



    OVERRULED



    455



    That healing gift He lends to them

    Who use it in His name
    The power that filled His garment

    Is evermore the same

    For lo  in human hearts unseen

    The Healer dwelleth still
    And they who make His temples clean

    The best subserve His will

    The holiest task by Heaven decreed

    An errand all divine
    The burden of our common need

    To render less is thine

    The paths of pain are thine Go forth
    With patience trust and hope

    The sufferings of a sinsick earth
    Shall give thee ample scope

    Beside the imveiled mysteries

    Of life and death go stand
    With guarded lips and reverent eyes

    And pure of heart and hand

    So shalt thou be with power endued

    From Him who went about
    The Syrian hillsides doing good

    And casting demons out

    That Good Physician liveth yet
    Thy friend and guide to be

    The Healer by Genuesaret

    Shall walk the rounds with thee



    THE TWO ANGELS

    God called the nearest angels who dwell

    with Him above
    The tenderest one was Pity the dearest

    one was Love

    Arise He said  my angels  a wail of

    woe and sin
    Steals through the gates of heaven and

    saddens all within

    My harps take up the mournful strain
    that from a lost world swells

    The smoke of torment clouds the light and
    blights the asphodels

    Fly downward to that under world and
    ou its souls of pain



    Let Love drop smiles like sunshine and
    Pity tears like rain

    Two faces bowed before the Throne veiled

    in their golden hair
    Four white wings lessened swiftly down

    the dark abyss of air

    The way was strange the flight was long

    at last the angels came
    Where swung the lost and nether world

    redwrapped in rayless flame

    There Pity shuddering wept  hnt Love
    with faith too strong for fear

    Took heart from Gods almightiness and
    smiled a smile of cheer

    And lo  that tear of Pity quenched the

    flame whereon it fell
    And with the sunshine of that smile hope

    entered into hell

    Two unveiled faces full of joy looked up
    ward to the Throne

    Four white wings folded at the feet of Him
    who sat thereon

    And deeper than the sound of seas more

    soft than falling flake
    Amidst the hush of wing and song the

    Voice Eternal spake

    Welcome my angels  ye have brought a

    holier joy to heaven
    Henceforth its sweetest song shall be the

    song of sin forgiven

    OVERRULED

    The threads our hands in blindness spin
    No selfdetermined plan weaves in
    The shuttle of the unseen powers
    Works out a pattern not as ouis

    Ah  small the choice of him who sings
    What sound shall leave the smitten strings
    Fate holds and guides the hand of art
    The singers is the servants part

    The windharp chooses not the tone

    That through its trembling threads is

    blown
    The patient organ cannot guess
    What hand its passive keys shall press

    Through wish resolve and act our will
    Is moved by undreamed forces stUl
    And no man measures in advance
    His strength with untried circumstance

    As runs the life the song must run
    But glad or sad to His good end
    God grant the varying notes may tend



    HYMN OF THE BUNKERS

    KLOSTER KEDAR EPHRATA PENNSYL
    VANIA 1738

    SISTER MARIA CHRISTIKA sings

    Wake sisters wake  the daystar shines
    Above Ephrata
    The dawn is breaking cool and calm
    Wake sisters wake to prayer and psalm

    Praised be the Lord for shade and light
    For toil by day for rest by night
    Praised be His name who deigns to bless
    Our Kedar of the wilderness

    s hand
    Was heavy on our native land
    And freedom to her children due
    The wolf and vulture only knew

    We praised Him when to prison led
    We owned Him when the stake blazed red
    We knew whatever might befall
    His love and power were over all

    He heard our prayers  with outstretched

    arm
    He led us forth from cruel harm
    Still wheresoe
    His cloud and fire before us went

    The watch of faith and prayer He set
    We kept it then we keep it yet
    At midnight crow of cock or noon
    He cometh sure He cometh soon

    He comes to chasten not destroy
    s alloy
    At last at last shall all confess
    His mercy as His righteousness

    The dead shall live the sick be whole
    The scarlet sin be white as wool



    No discord mar below above
    The music of eternal love

    Sound welcome trump the last alarm
    Lord God of hosts make bare thine arm
    Fulfil this day our long desire
    Make sweet and clean the world with fire

    Sweep flaming besom sweep from sight
    The lies of time  be swift to smite
    Sharp sword of God all idols down
    Genevan creed and Roman crown

    Quake earth through all thy zones till

    all
    The fanes of pride and priestcraft fall
    And lift thou up in place of them
    Thy gates of pearl Jerusalem

    Lo  rising from baptismal flame
    Transfigured glorious yet the same
    Within the heavenly city
    Our Kloster Kedar shall be found

    He cometh soon  at dawn or noon

    Or set of sun He cometh soon

    Our prayers shall meet Him on His way

    Wake sisters wake  arise and pray



    GIVING AND TAKING

    I have attempted to put in English verse a
    prose translation of a poem by Tinnevaluva a
    Hindoo poet of the third century of our era

    Who gives and hides the giving hand
    Nor counts on favor fame or praise
    Shall find his smallest gift outweighs

    The burden of the sea and laud

    Who gives to whom hath naught been given
    His gift in need though small indeed
    As is the grassblades windblown seed

    Is large as earth and rich as heaven

    Forget it not O man to whom

    A gift shall fall while yet on earth
    Yea even to thy sevenfold birth

    Recall it in the lives to come

    Who broods above a wrong in thought
    Sins much  but greater sin is his
    Who fed and clothed with kindnesses

    Shall count the holy alms as naught



    THE VISION


    OF ECHARD 457


    Who lares to curse the hands that bless


    Have I not dawns and sunsets


    Shall know of sin the deadliest cost


    Have I not winds that blow


    The patience of the heavens is lost




    Beholding man


    Do I smell your gums of incense




    Is my ear with chautings fed


    For he who breaks all laws may still


    Taste I your wine of worship


    In Sivams mercy be forgiven


    Or eat your holy bread


    But none can save in earth or heaven




    The wretch who answers good with ill


    Of rank and name and honors




    Am I vain as ye are vain




    What can Eternal Fulness


    THE VISION OF ECHARD


    From your lipservice gain


    The Benedictine Echard


    Ye make me not your debtor


    Sat by the wayside well


    Who serve yourselves alone


    Where Marsberg sees the bridal


    Ye boast to me of homage


    Of the Sarre and the Moselle


    Whose gain is all your own


    Fair with its sloping vineyards


    For you I gave the prophets


    And tawny chestnut bloom


    For you the Psalmists lay


    The happy vale Ausonius sung


    For you the laws stone tables


    For holy Treves made room


    And holy book and day


    On the shrine Helena builded


    Ye change to weary burdens


    To keep the Christ coat well


    The helps that should uplift


    On minster tower and kloster cross


    Ye lose in form the spirit


    The westering sunshine fell


    The Giver in the gift


    There where the rockhewn circles


    Who called ye to selftorment


    Oerlooked the Romans game


    To fast and penance vain


    The veil of sleep fell on him


    Dream ye Eternal Goodness


    And his thought a dream became


    Has joy in mortal pain


    He felt the heart of silence


    For the death in life of Nitria


    Throb with a soundless word


    For your Chartreuse ever dumb


    And by the inward ear alone


    What better is the neighbor


    A spirit


    Or happier the home


    And the spoken word seemed written


    s welfare


    On air and wave and sod


    As sacred as his own


    And the bending walls of sapphire


    And loves forgives and pities


    Blazed with the thought of God


    He serveth me alone



    What lack I O my children
    All things are in my hand
    The vast earth and the awful stars
    I hold as grains of sand

    Need I your alms  The silver
    And gold are mine alone
    The gifts ye bring before me
    Were evermore my own

    Heed I the noise of viols

    Your pomp of masque and show



    I note each gracious purpose
    Each kindly word and deed
    Are ye not all my children
    Shall not the Father heed

    No prayer for light and guidance
    Is lost upon mine ear
    The childs cry in the darkness
    Shall not the Father hear

    I loathe your wrangling councils
    I tread upon your creeds

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Who made ye mine avengers
    Or told ye of my needs

    I bless men and ye curse them
    I love them and ye hate
    Ye bite and tear each other
    I suffer long and wait

    Ye bow to ghastly symbols

    To cross and scourge and thorn
    Ye seek his Syrian manger
    Who in the heart is born

    For the dead Christ not the living
    Ye watch His empty giave
    Whose life alone within you
    Has power to bless and save

    O blind ones outward groping
    The idle quest forego
    Who listens to His inward voice
    Alone of Him shall know

    His love all love exceeding
    The heart must needs recall
    Its selfsurrendering freedom
    Its loss that gaineth all

    Climb not the holy mountains
    Their eagles know not me
    Seek not the Blessed Islands
    I dwell not in the sea

    Gone is the mount of Meru
    The triple gods are gone
    And deaf to all the lamas prayers
    The Buddha slumbers on

    No more from rocky Horeb
    The smitten waters gush
    Fallen is Bethel

    Quenched is the burning bush

    The jewels of the Urim

    And Thummim all are dim
    The fire has left the altar
    The sign the teraphim

    No more in ark or hill grove
    The Holiest abides
    Not in the scrolls dead letter
    The eternal secret hides

    The eye shall fail that searches
    For me the hollow sky



    The far is even as the near
    The low is as the high

    What if the earth is hiding

    Her old faiths long outworn

    What is it to the changeless truth

    That yours shall fail in turn

    What if the oerturned altar
    Lays bare the ancient lie
    What if the dreams and legends
    Of the worlds childhood die

    Have ye not still my witness
    Within yourselves alway
    My hand that on the keys of life
    For bliss or bale I lay

    Still in perpetual judgment
    I hold assize within
    With sure reward of holiness
    And dread rebuke of sin

    A light a guide a warning
    A presence ever near
    Through the deep silence of the flesh
    I reach the inward ear

    My Gerizim and Ebal

    Are in each human soul
    The still small voice of blessing
    And Sinais thunderroll

    The stern behest of duty

    The doombook open thrown
    The heaven ye seek the hell ye fear
    Are with yourselves alone



    A gold and purple simset

    Flowed down the broad Moselle
    On hills of vine and meadow lands

    The peace of twilight fell

    A slow cool wind of evening
    Blew over leaf and bloom

    And faint and far the Angeliis
    Rang from Saint Matthews tomb

    Then up rose Master Echard
    And marvelled   Can it be

    That here in dream and vision
    The Lord hath talked with me

    He went his way  behind him
    The shrines of saintly dead



    THE MINISTERS DAUGHTER

    His burdened soul to free

    Where the foothills of the Eifel
    Are glassed in Laachersee

    And in his Orders kloster
    He sat in nightlong parle

    With Tauler of the Friends of God
    And Nicolas of Basle

    And lo  the twain made answer
    Yea brother even thus

    The Voice above all voices
    Hath spoken unto us

    The world will have its idols

    And iiesh and sense their sign
    But the blinded eyes shall open
    And the gross ear be fine

    What if the vision tarry
    God
    The true Light shall be witnessed
    The Christ within confessed

    In mercy or in judgment

    He shall turn and overturn
    Till the heart shall be His temple
    Where all of Him shall learn

    Stranger and traveller
    Drink freely and bestow



    A kindly thought on her

    THE MINISTERS DAUGHTER

    In the minister
    He had told of the primal fall

    And how thenceforth the wrath of God
    Rested on each and all

    And how of His will and pleasure
    All souls save a chosen few

    Were doomed to the quenchless burning
    And held in the way thereto

    Yet never by faiths unreason

    A saintlier soul was tried
    And never the harsh old lesson

    A tenderer heart belied

    And after the painful service
    On that pleasant Sabbath day

    He walked with his little daughter
    Through the applebloom of May

    Sweet in the fresh green meadows
    Sparrow and blackbird sung

    Above him their tinted petals
    The blossoming orchards himg

    Around on the wonderful glory
    The minister looked and smiled
    How good is the Lord who gives us

    These gifts from His hand my child

    Behold in the bloom of apples
    And the violets in the sward
    A hint of the old lost beauty
    Of the Garden of the Lord

    Then up spake the little maiden
    Treading on snow and pink
    O father  these pretty blossoms
    Are very wicked I think

    Had there been no Garden of Eden

    There never had been a fall

    And if never a tree had blossomed

    God would have loved us all

    RELIGIOUS POEMS



    Hush child   the father answered

    By His decree man fell
    His ways are in clouds and darkness

    But He doeth all things well

    And whether by His ordaining

    To us Cometh good or ill
    Joy or pain or light or shadow

    We must fear and love Him still

    Oh I fear Him
    And I try to love Him too

    But I wish He was good and gentle
    Kind and loving as you

    The minister groaned in spirit
    As the tremulous lips of pain

    And wide wet eyes uplifted
    Questioned his own in vain

    Bowing his head he pondered
    The words of the little one

    Had he erred in his lifelong teaching
    Had he wrong to his Master done

    To what grim and dreadful idol
    Had he lent the holiest name

    Did his own heai
    The God of his worship shame

    And lo  from the bloom and greenness
    From the tender skies above

    And the face of his little daughter
    He read a lesson of love

    No more as the cloudy terror

    Of Sinais mount of law
    But as Christ in the Syrian lilies

    The vision of God he saw

    And as when in the clefts of Horeb
    Of old was His presence known

    The dread Ineffable Glory
    Was Infinite Goodness alone

    Thereafter his hearers noted

    In his prayers a tenderer strain

    And never the gospel of hatred
    Burned on his lips again

    And the scoffing tongue was prayerful
    And the blinded eyes found sight

    And hearts as flint aforetime

    Grew soft in his warmth and light



    BY THEIR WORKS

    Call him not heretic whose works attest
    His faith in goodness by no creed confessed
    Whatever in love
    To free the bound and lift the fallen one
    Is done to Christ Whoso in deed and

    word
    Is not against Him labors for our Lord
    When He who sad and weary longing

    sore
    For loves sweet service sought the sisters

    door
    One saw the heavenly one the human guest
    But who shall say which loved the Master

    best

    AN EASTER FLOWER GIFT

    O DEAREST bloom the seasons know
    Flowers of the Resurrection blow

    Our hope and faith restore
    And through the bitterness of death
    And loss and sorrow breathe a breath

    Of life f orevermore

    The thought of Love Immortal blends

    THE MYSTICS CHRISTMAS

    All hail   the bells of Christmas rang
    All hail   the monks at Christmas sang
    The merry monks who kept with cheer
    The gladdest day of all their year

    But still apart unmoved thereat
    A pious elder brother sat



    Silent in his accustomed place

    With God

    Why sittst thou thus

    cried
    It is the blessed Christmastide
    The Christmas lights are all aglow
    The sacred lilies bud and blow

    Above our heads the joybells ring
    Without the happy children sing
    And all Gods creatures hail the morn
    On which the holy Christ was born

    Rejoice with us  no more rebuke
    Our gladness with thy quiet look
    Keep I pray
    Even as ye list the Lord

    Let heathen Yule fires flicker red
    Where thronged refectory feasts are

    spread
    With mysteryplay and masque and mime
    And waitsongs speed the holy time

    The blindest faith may haply save
    The Lord accepts the things we have
    And reverence howsoeer it strays
    May find at last the shining ways

    They needs must grope who cannot see
    The blade before the ear must be
    As ye are feeling I have felt
    And where ye dwell I too have dwelt

    But now beyond the things of sense
    Beyond occasions and events
    I know through God
    Release from form and time and place

    I listen from no mortal tongue
    To hear the song the angels sung
    And wait within myself to know
    The Christmas lilies bud and blow

    The outward symbols disappear
    From him whose inward sight is clear
    And small must be the choice of days
    To him who fills them all with praise

    Keep while you need it brothers mine
    With honest zeal your Christmas sign
    But judge not him who every morn
    Feels in his heart the Lord Christ born I



    WHAT THE TRAVELLER SAID AT SUNSET



    463



    AT LAST

    Recited by one of the little group of rela
    s bedside as the
    last moment of his life apxroached

    When on my day of life the night is fall
    ing
    And in the winds from unsunned spaces
    blown
    I hear far voices out of darkness calling
    My feet to paths unknown

    Thou who hast made my home of life so
    pleasant
    Leave not its tenant when its walls decay

    Love Divine O Helper ever present
    Be Thou my strength and stay

    Be near me when all else is from me drift
    ing
    Earth sky home
    shade and shine
    And kindly faces to my own uplifting
    The love which answers mine

    1 have but Thee my Father  let Thy spirit
    Be with me then to comfort and uphold

    No gate of pearl no branch of palm I
    merit
    Nor street of shining gold

    Suffice it if  my good and ill unreckoned
    And both forgiven through Thy abound
    ing grace

    I find myself by hands familiar beckoned
    Unto my fitting place

    Some humble door among Thy many man
    sions
    Some sheltering shade where sin and
    striving cease
    s green
    expansions
    The river of Thy peace

    There from the music round about me
    stealing
    I fain would learn the new and holy
    song
    And find at last beneath Thy trees of
    healing
    The life for which I long



    WHAT THE TRAVELLER SAID
    AT SUNSET

    The shadows grow and deepen round me

    I feel the dewfall in the air
    The muezzin of the darkening thicket

    I hear the nightthrush call to prayer

    The evening wind is sad with farewells
    And loving hands unclasp from mine

    Alone I go to meet the darkness
    Across an awful boundaryline

    As from the lighted hearths behind me
    I pass with slow reluctant feet

    What waits me in the land of strangeness
    What face shall smile what voice shall
    greet

    What space shall awe what brightness
    blind me

    What thunderroll of music stun
    What vast processions sweep before me

    Of shapes unknown beneath the sun

    I shrink from unaccustomed glory
    I dread the myriadvoiced strain

    Give me tlie unforgotten faces
    And let my lost ones speak again

    He will not chide my mortal yearning
    Who is our Brother and our Friend

    In whose full life divine and human
    The heavenly and the earthly blend

    Mine be the joy of soidcommunion

    The sense of spiritual strength renewed

    The reverence for the pure and holy
    The dear delight of doing good

    No fitting ear is mine to listen

    An endless anthem

    No curious eye is mine to measure
    The pearl gate and the jasper wall

    For love must needs be more than know
    ledge

    What matter if I never know
    Why Aldebarans star is ruddy

    Or warmer Sirius white as snow

    Forgive my human words O Father I
    I go Thy larger truth to prove

    THE STORY OF IDA

    Francesca Alexander whose pen and pencil
    have so reverently transcribed the simple faith
    and life of the Italian peasantry wrote the
    s intro
    duction under the title The Story of Ida

    Weary of jangling noises never stilled
    The skeptics sneer the bigots hate the

    din
    Of clashing texts the webs of creed
    men spin
    Round simple truth the children grown

    who build
    With gilded cards their new Jerusalem
    Busy with sacerdotal tailorings
    And tinsel gauds bedizening holy things
    I turn with glad and grateful heart from

    them
    To the sweet story of the Florentine
    Immortal in her blameless maidenhood
    Beautiful as God
    Feeling that life even now may be divine
    With love no wrong can ever change to

    hate
    No sin make less than allcompassionate



    THE LIGHT THAT IS FELT

    A TENDER child of summers three
    Seeking her little bed at night

    Paused on the dark stair timidly

    Oh mother  Take my hand
    And then the dark will all be light

    We older children grope our way

    From dark behind to dark before
    And only when our hands we lay
    Dear Lord in Thine the night is day
    And there is darkness nevermore

    Reach downward to the sunless days

    Wherein our guides are blind as we
    And faith is small and hope delays



    Take Thou the hands of prayer we raise
    And let us feel the light of Thee



    THE TWO LOVES

    Smoothing soft the nestling head

    Of a maiden fancyled

    Thus a graveeyed woman said

    Richest gifts are those we make
    Dearer than the love we take
    That we give for love

    s unrest
    Mine has been the common quest
    To be loved and therefore blest

    Favors undeserved were mine
    At my feet as on a shrine
    Love has laid its gifts divine

    Sweet the offerings seemed and yet
    With their sweetness came regret
    And a sense of unpaid debt

    Heart of mine imsatisfied
    Was it vanity or pride
    That a deeper joy denied

    Hands that ope but to receive
    Empty close  they only live
    Richly who can richly give

    Still she sighed with moistening eyes
    Love is sweet in any guise
    But its best is sacrifice

    He who giving does not crave
    Likest is to Him who gave
    Life itself the loved to save

    Love that selfforgetful gives
    Sows surprise of ripened sheaves
    Late or soon its own receives



    ADJUSTMENT

    The tree of Faith its bare dry boughs must

    HYMNS OF THE BRAHMO SOMAJ



    465



    The old lament be heard

    dead
    That wail is Error
    hurled
    This sharp recoil is Evil undertrod
    Our times unrest an angel sent of God
    Troubling with life the waters of the world
    Even as they list the winds of the Spirit
    blow
    To turn or break our century  rusted

    vanes
    Sands shift and waste  the rock alone
    remains
    Where led of Heaven the strong tides

    come and go
    And stormclouds rent by thunderbolt and

    wind
    Leave free of mist the permanent stars
    behind

    Therefore I trust although to outward sense
    Both true and false seem shaken  I will

    hold
    With newer light my reverence for the
    old
    And calmly wait the births of Providence
    No gain is lost  the cleareyed saints look
    down
    Untroubled on the wreck of schemes and

    creeds
    Love yet remains its rosary of good
    deeds
    Counting in taskfield and o
    Truth has charmed life  the Inward Word
    survives
    And day by day its revelation brings
    Faith hope and charity whatsoever
    things
    Which cannot be shaken stand Still holy

    lives
    Reveal the Christ of whom the letter told
    And the new gospel verifies the old



    HYMNS OF THE BRAHMO
    SOMAJ

    I have attempted this paraphrase of the
    Hymns of the Brahmo yomaj of India as I
    s account of the devo
    tional exercises of that remarkable relioious
    development wliich has attracted far less atten
    tion and sympathy from the Christian world
    than it deserves as a fresh revelation of the
    direct action of the Divine Spirit upon the hu
    man heart



    The mercy O Eternal One

    By man unmeasured yet
    In joy or grief in shade or sun

    I never will forget
    I give the whole and not a part

    Of all Thou gavest me
    My goods my life my soul and heart

    I yield them all to Thee



    We fast and plead we weep and pray

    From morning until even
    We feel to find the holy way

    We knock at the gate of heaven
    And when in silent awe we wait

    And word and sign forbear
    The hinges of the golden gate

    Move soundless to our prayer
    Who hears the eternal harmonies

    Can heed no outward word
    Blind to all else is he who sees

    The vision of the Lord



    O soul be patient restrain thy tears

    Have hope and not despair
    As a tender mother heareth her child

    God hears the penitent prayer
    And not forever shall grief be thine

    On the Heavenly Mother
    Washed clean and white in waters of joy

    Shall His seeking child find rest
    Console thyself with His word of grace

    And cease thy wail of woe
    For His mercy never an equal hath

    And His love no bounds can know
    Lean close unto Him in faith and hope

    How many like thee have found
    In Him a shelter and home of peace

    By His mercy compassed round
    There safe from sin and the sorrow it
    brings

    They sing their gratefid psalms
    And rest at noon by the wells of God

    In the shade of His holy palms

    REVELATION

    THE CHRISTMAS OF 1888

    Low in the east against a white cold

    dawn
    The blacklined silhouette of the woods was

    drawn
    And on a wintry waste
    Of frosted streams and hillsides bare and

    brown
    Through thin cloudfilms a pallid ghost

    looked down
    The waning moon halffaced

    In that pale sky and sere snowwaiting

    earth
    What sign was there of the immortal birth

    What herald of the One
    Lo  swift as thought the heavenly radiance

    came
    A rosered splendor swept the sky like
    flame
    Up rolled the round bright sun

    And all was changed From a transfigured
    world

    The moon
    hearths curled
    Up the still air unblown

    In Orient warmth and brightness did that
    morn

    Oer Nain and Nazareth when the Christ
    was born
    Break fairer than our own



    467



    The morning
    filled
    In warm soft sky and landscape hazyhilled

    And sunset fair as they
    A sweet reminder of His holiest time
    A summermiracle in our winter clime

    God gave a perfect day

    The near was blended with the old and far

    And Bethlehems hillside and the Magi

    star

    Seemed here as there and then

    Our homestead pinetree was the Syrian

    THE VOW OF WASHINGTON

    Read in New York April 30 1889 at the
    Centennial Celebration of the Inauguration of
    George Washington as the first President of the
    United States

    s sun
    Lay green the fields by Freedom won
    And severed sections weary of debates
    Joined hands at last and were United
    States

    O City sitting by the Sea

    How proud the day that dawned on thee
    When the new era long desired began
    And in its need the hour had found the



    One thought the cannon salvos spoke
    The resonant belltower
    The voiceful streets the plauditechoing

    halls
    And prayer and hymn borne heavenward
    from St Pauls

    How felt the land in every part
    The strong throb of a nation



    468



    AT SUNDOWN



    As its great leader gave with reverent awe
    His pledge to Union Liberty and Law

    That pledge the heavens above him

    heard
    That vow the sleep of centuries stirred
    In worldwide wonder listening peoples

    bent
    Their gaze on Freedoms great experiment

    Could it succeed  Of honor sold
    And hopes deceived all history told

    Above the wrecks that strewed the mourn
    ful past

    Was the long dream of ages true at last

    Thank God  the people
    The one man equal to his trust

    Wise beyond lore and without weakness
    good

    Calm in the strength of flawless rectitude

    His rule of justice order peace
    s release
    Taught prince and serf that power is but a

    trust
    And rule alone which serves the ruled is
    just

    That Freedom generous is but strong
    In hate of fraud and selfish wrong
    Pretence that turns her holy truth to lies
    And lawless license masking in her guise

    Land of his love  with one glad voice
    Let thy great sisterhood rejoice
    A centurys suns oer thee have risen and set
    And God be praised we are one nation yet

    And still we trust the years to be
    Shall prove his hope was destiny
    Leaving our flag with all its added stars
    Unrent by faction and unstained by wars

    Lo  where with patient toil he nursed
    And trained the newset plant at first
    The widening branches of a stately tree
    Stretch from the sunrise to the sunset sea

    And in its broad and sheltering shade
    Sitting with none to make afraid
    Were we now silent through each mighty

    limb
    The winds of heaven would sing the praise
    of him



    Our first and best   his ashes lie
    Beneath his own Virginian sky
    Forgive forget O true and just and brave
    The storm that swept above thy sacred
    grave

    For ever in the awful stiife
    And dark hours of the nation
    Through the fierce tumult pierced his

    warning word
    Their fathers voice his erring children
    heard

    The change for which he prayed and

    sought
    In that sharp agony was wrought
    No partial interest draws its alien line
    Twixt North and South the cypress and
    the pine

    One people now all doubt beyond
    His name shall be our Unionbond

    We lift our hands to Heaven and here and
    now

    Take on our lips the old Centennial vow

    For rule and trust must needs be ours

    Chooser and chosen both are powers
    Equal in service as in rights  the claim
    Of Duty rests on each and all the same

    Then let the sovereign millions where
    Our banner floats in sun and air

    s
    cold

    Repeat with us the pledge a century old



    THE CAPTAIN

    The story of the shipwreck of Captain Val
    entine Bagley on the coast of Arabia and his
    sufferings in tlie desert has been familiar from
    my childhood It has been partially told hi the
    singularly beautiful lines of my friend Har
    riet Prescott Spofford on the occasion of a pub
    lic celebration at tlie Newbnryport Library
    To the charm and felicity of her verse as far
    as it goes nothing can be added  but in the
    following ballad I have endeavored to give a
    fuller detail of the touching incident upon
    which it is founded

    From pain and peril by laud and main
    The shipwrecked sailor came back again



    THE CAPTAIN



    469



    And like one from the dead the threshold

    crossed
    Of his wondering home that had mourned

    him lost

    Where he sat once more with his kith and

    kin
    And welcomed his neighbors thronging in

    But when morning came he called for his

    spade
    I must pay my debt to the Lord he said

    Why dig you here   asked the passer
    by

    Is there gold or silver the road so
    nigh

    No friend he answered   but under

    this sod
    Is the blessed water the wine of God

    Water  the Powow is at your back
    And right before you the Merrimac

    And look you up or look you down
    There s a wellsweep at every door in
    town

    True he said we have wells of our

    own
    But this I dig for the Lord alone

    Said the other   This soil is dry you

    know
    I doubt if a spring can be found below

    You had better consult before you dig
    Some water witch with a hazel twig

    No wet or dry I will dig it here
    Shallow or deep if it takes a year

    In the Arab desert where shade is none
    The waterless land of sand and sun

    Under the pitiless brazen sky

    My burning throat as the sand was dry

    My crazed brain listened in fever dreams
    For plash of buckets and ripple of streams

    And opening my eyes to the blinding glare
    And my lips to the breath of the blistering
    air



    Tortured alike by the heavens and earth
    I cursed like Job the day of my birth

    Then something tender and sad and mild
    As a mothers voice to her wandering chUd

    Rebuked my frenzy  and bowing my

    head
    I prayed as I never before had prayed

    Plhj me God  for I die of thirst
    Take me out of this land accurst j

    A7id if ever I reach iny home again
    Where earth has springs and the sky has
    rain

    1 will dig a well for the passersby
    And none shall suffer from thirst as I

    I saw as I prayed my home once more
    The house the barn the elms by the door

    The grass  lined road that riverward

    wound
    The tall slate stones of the buryingground

    The belfry and steeple on meetinghouse

    hill
    The brook with its dam and gray grist mill

    And I knew in that vision beyond the

    sea
    The very place where my well must be

    God heard my prayer in that evil day
    He led my feet in their homeward way

    From false mirage and driedup well
    And the hot sand storms of a land of hell

    Till I saw at last through the coasthill

    gap
    A city held in its stony lap

    The mosques and the domes of scorched

    Muscat
    And my heart leaped up with joy thereat

    For there was a ship at anchor lying
    A Christian flag at its masthead flying

    And sweetest of sounds to my homesick

    ear
    s cheer



    470



    AT SUNDOWN



    Now the Lord be thanked I am back

    again
    Where earth has springs and the skies have

    rain

    And the well I promised by Oman
    I am digging for him in Amesbury

    His kindred wept and his neighbors said
    The poor old captain is out of his head

    But from morn to noon and from noon to

    He toiled at his task with main and might

    And when at last from the loosened earth
    Under his spade the stream gushed forth

    s

    brim
    The water he dug for followed him

    He shouted for joy

    word
    And here is the well I promised the Lord

    The long years came and the long years

    went
    And he sat by his roadside well content

    He watched the travellers heatoppressed
    Pause by the way to drink and rest

    And the sweltering horses dip as they

    drank
    Their nostrils deep in the cool sweet tank

    And grateful at heart his memory went
    Back to that waterless Orient

    And the blessed answer of prayer which

    came
    To the earth of iron and sky of flame

    And when a wayfarer weary and hot
    Kept to the mid road pausing not

    For the well

    head
    He dont know the value of water

    said

    Had he prayed for a drop as I have done
    In the desert circle of sand and sun



    He would drink and rest and go home to

    tell
    That Gods best gift is the wayside well



    AN OUTDOOR RECEPTION

    The substance of these lines hastily pen
    cilled several years ago I find among such of
    my unprinted scraps as have escaped the waste
    basket and the fire In transcribing it I have
    made some changes additions and omissions

    Ox these green banks where falls too

    soon
    The shade of Autumn
    The south wind blowing soft and sweet
    The water gliding at my feet
    The distant northern range uplit
    By the slant sunshine over it
    With changes of the mountain mist
    From tender blush to amethyst
    The valleys stretch of shade and gleam
    Fair as in Mirza
    With glad young faces smiling near
    And merry voices in my ear
    I sit methiuks as Hafiz might
    In Irans Garden of Delight
    For Persian roses blushing red
    Aster and gentian bloom instead
    For Shiraz wine this mountain air
    For feast the blueberries which I share
    With one who proffers with stained hands
    Her gleanings from yon pasture lands
    Wild fruit that art and culture spoil
    The harvest of an untilled soil
    And with her one whose tender eyes
    Reflect the change of April skies
    Midway
    Fresh as Springs earliest violet
    And one whose look and voice and ways
    Make where she goes idyllic days
    And one whose sweet still comitenance
    Seems dreamful of a child
    And others welcome as are these
    Like and unlike varieties
    Of pearls on natures chaplet strung
    And all are fair for all are young
    Gathered from seaside cities old
    From midland prairie lake and wold
    From the great wheatfields which might

    feed
    The hunger of a world at need
    In healthful change of rest and play
    Their schoolvacations glide away

    471



    No critics these  they only see
    An old aud kindly friend in me
    la whose amnsed indulgent look
    Their innocent mirth has no rebuke
    They scarce can know my rugged rhymes
    The harsher songs of evil times
    Nor graver themes in minor keys
    Of lifes and deaths solemnities
    But haply as they bear in mind
    Some verse of lighter happier kind
    Hints of the boyhood of the man
    Youth viewed from life
    Half seriously and half in play
    My pleasant interviewers pay
    Their visit with no fell intent
    Of taking notes and punishment

    As yonder solitary pine
    Is ringed below with flower and vine
    More favored than that lonely tree
    The bloom of girlhood circles me
    In such an atmosphere of youth
    I half forget my ages truth
    The shadow of my life
    Runs backward on the dialplate
    Until it seems a step might span
    The gulf between the boy and man

    My young friends smile as if some jay
    On bleak Decembers leafless spray
    Essayed to sing the songs of May
    Well let them smile and live to know
    When their brown locks are flecked with

    snow
    T is tedious to be always sage
    And pose the dignity of age
    While so much of our early lives
    On memorys playground still survives
    And owns as at the present hour
    The spell of youth

    But though I feel with Solomon

    T is pleasant to behold the sun

    I would not if I could repeat

    A life which still is good and sweet

    I keep in age as in my prime

    A not uncheerful step with time

    And grateful for all blessings sent

    I go the common way content

    To make no new experiment

    On easy terms with law and fate

    For what must be I calmly wait

    And trust tlie path I cannot see

    That God is good sufficcth me

    Aud when at last on life



    The curtain falls I only pray
    That hope may lose itself in truth
    And age in Heavens immortal youth
    And all our loves and longing prove
    The foretaste of diviner love

    The day is done Its afterglow

    Along the west is burning low

    My visitors like birds have flown

    I hear their voices fainter grown

    And dimly through the dusk I see

    Their kerchiefs wave goodnight to me

    Light hearts of girlhood knowing naught

    Of all the cheer their coming brought

    And in their going unaware

    Of silentfollowing feet of prayer

    Heaven make their budding promise good

    With flowers of gracious womanhood

    Make for he loved thee well our Merri
    mac
    From wave and shore a low and long

    lament
    For him whose last look sought thee as
    he went
    The unknown way from which no step

    comes back
    And ye O ancient pinetrees at whose
    feet
    He watched in life the sunset
    ing glow
    Let the soft south wind through your
    needles blow
    A fitting requiem tenderly and sweet
    No fonder lover of all lovely things

    Shall walk where once he walked no

    smile more glad
    Greet friends than his who friends in all
    men had
    Whose pleasant memory to that Island

    clings
    Where a dear mourner in the home he left
    Of loves sweet solace cannot be bereft

    AT SUNDOWN



    O ships of mine whose swift keels cleft
    The enchanted sea on which they sailed

    Are these poor fragments only left

    Of vain desires and hopes that failed

    Did I not watch from them the light
    Of sunset on my towers in Spain

    And see far oP iiploom in sight

    The Fortunate Isles I might not gain

    Did sudden lift of fog reveal

    Arcadias vales of song and spring

    And did I pass with grazing keel
    The rocks whereon the sirens sing

    Have I not drifted hard upon

    The unmapped regions lost to man

    The cloudpitched tents of Prester John
    The palace domes of Kubla Khan

    Did land winds blow from jasmine flowers
    Where Youth the ageless Fountain fills

    Did Love make sign from rose blown bow
    ers
    And gold from Eldorado

    Alas  the gallant ships that sailed
    On blind Adventures errand sent

    Howe
    To reach the haven of Content

    And of my ventures those alone

    Which Love had freighted safely sped

    Seeking a good beyond my own
    By cleareyed Duty piloted

    mariners hoping still to meet
    The luck Arabian voyagers met

    And find in Bagdads moonlit street
    Haroun al Raschid walking yet

    Take with you on your Sea of Dreams
    The fair fond fancies dear to youth

    1 turn from all that only seems

    And seek the sober grounds of truth

    What matter that it is not May

    That birds have flown and trees are
    bare
    That darker grows the shortening day

    And colder blows the wintry air

    The wrecks of passion and desire
    The castles I no more rebuild



    May fitly feed my cTriftwood fire

    And warm the hands that age has chilled

    Whatever perished with my ships
    I only know the best remains

    A song of praise is on my lips

    For losses which are now my gains

    Heap high my hearth  No worth is lost

    No wisdom with the folly dies
    Burn on poor shreds your holocaust

    Shall be my evening sacrifice

    Far more than all I dared to dream
    Unsought before my door I see

    On wings of fire and steeds of steam
    The world

    And holier signs unmarked before
    Of Love to seek and Power to save

    The righting of the wronged and poor
    The man evolving from the slave

    And life no longer chance or fate
    Safe in the gracious Fatherhood

    I fold oerwearied hands and wait
    In full assurance of the good

    And well the waiting time must be
    Though brief or long its granted days

    If Faith and Hope and Charity

    Sit by my evening hearthfire

    And with them friends whom Heaven has
    spared

    Whose love my heart has comforted
    And sharing all my joys has shared

    My tender memories of the dead

    Dear souls who left us lonely here

    Bound on their last long voyage to
    whom

    We day by day are drawing near
    Where every bark has sailing room

    I know the solemn monotone

    Of waters calling unto me
    I know from whence the airs have blown

    That whisper of the Eternal Sea

    As low my fires of driftwood burn

    O W HOLMES ON HIS EIGHTI
    ETH BIRTHDAY

    Climbing a path which leads back never
    more
    We heard behind his footsteps and liis
    cheer
    Now face to face we greet him standing

    here
    Upon the lonely summit of Fourscore
    Welcome to us o
    day
    Is closing and the shadows colder grow
    His genial presence like an afterglow
    Following the one just vanishing away
    Long be it ere the table shall be set
    For the last breakfast of the Autocrat
    And love repeat with smiles and tears
    thereat
    His own sweet songs that time shall not

    forget
    Waiting with us the call to come up higher
    Life is not less the heavens are only nigher

    O RIVER winding to the sea
    We call the old time back to thee
    From forest paths and waterways
    The centurywoven veil we raise



    The voices of today are dumb
    Unheard its sounds that go and come
    We listen tlirough longlapsing years
    To footsteps of the pioneers

    Gone steepled town and cultured plain

    The wilderness returns again

    Tlie drear untrodden solitude

    The gloom and mystery of the wood

    Once more the bear and panther prowl
    The wolf repeats his hungry howl
    And peering through his leafy screen
    The Indian

    We see their rudebuilt huts beside
    Grave men and women anxiouseyed
    And wistful youth remembering still
    Dear homes in Englands Haverhill

    We summon forth to mortal view
    Dark Passaquo and Saggahew
    Wild chiefs who owned the mighty sway
    Of wizard Passaconaway

    Weird memories of the border town
    By old tradition handed down
    In chance and change before us pass
    Like pictures in a magic glass

    The terror of the midnight raid
    The deathconcealing ambuscade
    The winter march through deserts wild
    Of captive mother wife and child

    Ah  bleeding hands alone subdued
    And tamed the savage habitude
    Of forests hiding beasts of prey
    And human shapes as fierce as they

    Slow from the plough the woods withdrew
    Slowly each year the cornlands grew
    Nor fire nor frost nor foe could kill
    The Saxon energy of will

    And never in the hamlet
    Was lack of sturdy manhood found
    And never failed the kindred good
    Of brave and helpful womanhood

    That hamlet now a city is
    Its logbuilt huts are palaces

    AT SUNDOWN



    And far and wide it stretches still
    Along its southward sloping hill
    And overlooks on either hand
    A rich and manywatered land

    And gladdening all the landscape fair

    As Pison was to Edens pair

    Our river to its valley brings

    The blessing of its mountain springs

    And Nature holds with narrowing space
    From mart and crowd her old  time

    grace
    And guards with fondly jealous arms
    The wild growths of outlying farms

    Her sunsets on Kenoza fall
    Her autumn leaves by Saltonstall
    No lavished gold can richer make
    Her opulence of hill and lake

    Wise was the choice which led our sires
    To kindle here their household fires
    And share the large content of all
    Whose lines in pleasant places fall

    More dear as years on years advance
    We prize the old inheritance
    And feel as far and wide we roam
    That all we seek we leave at home

    Our palms are pines our oranges
    Are apples on our orchard trees
    Our thrushes are our nightingales
    Our larks the blackbirds of our vales

    No incense which the Orient burns
    Is sweeter than our hillside ferns
    What tropic splendor can outvie
    Our autumn woods our sunset sky

    If where the slow years came and went
    And left not affluence but content
    Now flashes iu our dazzled eyes
    The electric light of enterprise

    And if the old idyllic ease

    Seems lost in keen activities

    And crowded workshops now replace

    The hearths and farmfields rustic grace

    No dull mechanic round of toil
    Life
    And youth and beauty hand in hand
    Will always find enchanted land



    No task is ill where hand and brain
    And skill and strength have equal gain
    And each shall each in honor hold
    And simple manhood outweigh gold

    Earth shall be near to Heaven when all
    That severs man from man shall fall
    s plan
    Alone is love of God and man

    dwellers by the Merrimac

    The heirs of centuries at your back
    Still reaping where you have not sown
    A broader field is now your own

    Hold fast your Puritan heritage
    But let the free thought of the age
    Its light and hope and sweetness add
    To the stern faith the fathers had

    Adrift on Time
    As waves that follow waves we glide
    God grant we leave upon the shore
    Some waif of good it lacked before

    Some seed or flower or plant of worth
    Some added beauty to the earth
    Some larger hope some thought to make
    The sad world happier for its sake

    As tenants of uncertain stay
    So may we live our little day
    That only grateful hearts shall fill
    The homes we leave in Haverhill

    The singer of a farewell rhyme
    Upon whose outmost verge of time
    The shades of night are falling down

    1 pray God bless the good old town

    Proof that upon their centuryrooted

    The English roses bloom as fresh as ever

    Take the warm welcome of new friends
    with thee
    And listening to thy home

    chime
    Dream that thou hearest with it keep
    ing time
    The bells on Merrimac sound across the
    sea

    Think of our thrushes when the lark sings
    clear
    Of our sweet Mayflowers when the dai
    sies bloom
    And bear to our and thy ancestral home
    The kindly greeting of its children here

    Say that our love survives the severing
    strain
    That the New England with the Old

    holds fast
    The proud fond memories of a common
    past
    Unbroken still the ties of blood remain

    THE BIRTHDAY WREATH

    December 17 1891

    Blossom and greenness making all
    The winter birthday tropical

    And the plain Quaker parlors gay
    Have gone from bracket stand and wall
    We saw them fade and droop and fall

    And laid them tenderly away

    White virgin lilies mignonette
    Blown rose and pink and violet

    A breath of fragrance passing by
    Visions of beauty and decay
    Colors and shapes that could not stay

    The fairest sweetest first to die

    But still this rustic wreath of mine
    Of acorued oak and needled pine

    And lighter growths of forest lands
    Woven and wound with careful pains
    And tender thoughts and prayers remains

    s dear
    hands

    And not unfitly garlanded

    Is he who countryborn and bred

    Welcomes the sylvan ring which gives
    A feeling of old stmimer days
    The wild delight of woodland ways

    The glory of the autumn leaves

    And if the flowery meed of song
    To other bards may well belong

    Be his who from the farmfield spoke
    A word for Freedom when her need
    W as not of dulcimer and reed

    This Isthmian wreath of pine and oak

    THE WIND OF MARCH

    Up from the sea the wild north wind is
    blowing
    Under the sky
    Smiling I watch the shaken elmboughs
    knowing
    It is the wind of March

    Between the passing and the coming season

    This stormy interlude
    Gives to our winterwearied hearts a reason

    For trustful gratitude

    Welcome to waiting ears its harsh fore
    warning
    Of light and warmth to come
    s Easter
    morning
    The earth arisen in bloom

    In the loud tumult winter
    breaking

    I listen to the sound
    As to a voice of resurrection waking

    To life the dead cold ground

    Between these gusts to the soft lapse I
    hearken
    Of rivulets on their way
    I see these tossed and naked treetops
    darken
    With the fresh leaves of May

    This roar of storm this sky so gray and
    lowering

    Invite the airs of Spring
    A warmer sunshine over fields of flowering

    The bluebirds song and wing

    Closely behind the Gulf
    follow
    This northern hurricane
    And borne thereon the bobolink and swal
    low
    Shall visit us again

    And in green woodpaths in the kinefed
    pasture
    And by the whispering rills
    Shall flowers repeat the lesson of the Mas
    ter
    Taught on his Syrian hills



    Blow then wild wind  thy roar shall end
    in singing
    Thy chill in blossoming
    Come like Bethesdas troubling angel
    bringing
    The healing of the Spring



    BETWEEN THE GATES

    Between the gates of birth and death
    An old and saintly pilgrim passed

    With look of one who witnesseth
    The longsought goal at last

    O thou whose reverent feet have found
    The Masters footprints in thy way

    And walked thereon as holy ground
    A boon of thee I pray

    My lack would borrow thy excess
    My feeble faith the strength of thine

    I need thy soul
    To hide the stains of mine

    The grace and favor else denied
    May well be granted for thy sake

    So tempted doubting sorely tried
    A younger pilgrim spake

    Thy prayer my son transcends my gift

    No power is mine the sage replied
    The burden of a soul to lift

    Or stain of sin to hide

    Howeer the outward life may seem
    For pardoning grace we all must pray

    No man his brother can redeem
    Or a soul

    Not always age is growth of good

    Its years have losses with their gain
    Against some evil youth withstood

    Weak hands may strive in vain

    With deeper voice than any speech
    Of mortal lips from man to man

    What earths unwisdom may not teach
    The Spirit only can

    Make thou that holy guide thine own
    And following where it leads the way

    The known shall lapse in the unknown
    As twilight into day



    TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES

    THE LAST EVE OF SUMMER

    Summers last sun nigh unto setting shines
    Through yon columnar pines

    And on the deepening shadows of the
    lawn
    Its golden lines are drawn

    Dreaming of long gone summer days like
    this

    Feeling the wind
    Grateful and glad tliat failing ear and sight

    Have still their old delight

    I sit alone and watch the warm sweet
    day

    Lapse tenderly away
    And wistful with a feeling of forecast

    I ask  Is this the last

    Will nevermore for me the seasons run
    Their round and will the sun

    Of ardent summers yet to come forget
    For me to rise and set

    Thou shouldst be here or I should be with
    thee
    Wherever thou mayst be
    Lips mute hands clasped in silences of
    speech
    Each answering unto each

    For this still hour this sense of mystery
    far

    Beyond the evening star
    No words outworn suffice on lip or scroll

    The soul would fain with soul

    Wait while these few swiftpassing days
    fulfil

    The wisedisposing Will
    And in the evening as at morning trust

    The AllMerciful and Just

    The solemn joy that soulcommunion feels

    Immortal life reveals
    And human love its prophecy and sign

    Interprets love divine



    Come then in thought If that alone may be
    O friend  and bring with thee

    Thy calm assurance of transcendent Spheres
    And the Eternal Years

    s poems was
    written but a few weeks before his death

    Among the thousands who with hail and
    cheer

    Will welcome thy new year
    How few of all have passed as thou and I

    So many milestones by

    We have grown old together  we have
    seen

    Our youth and age between
    Two generations leave us and today

    We with the third hold way

    Loving and loved If thought must back
    ward run

    To those who one by one
    In the great silence and the dark beyond

    Vanished with farewells fond

    Unseen not lost  our grateful memories
    still
    Their vacant places fill
    And witli the fullvoiced greeting of new
    friends
    A tenderer whisper blends

    Linked close in a pathetic brotherhood

    Of mingled ill and good
    Of joy and grief of grandeur and of shame

    For pity more than blame

    The gift is thine the weary world to make
    More cheerful for thy sake

    Soothing the ears its Miserere pains
    With the old Hellenic strains

    Lighting the sullen face of discontent
    With smiles for blessing sent

    Enough of selfish wailing has been had
    Thank God  for notes more glad

    Life is indeed no holiday  therein
    Are want and woe and sin

    Death aud its nameless fears and over all
    Our pitying tears must fall

    Sorrow is real  but the counterfeit

    Which folly brings to it
    We need thy wit and wisdom to resist

    O rarest Optimist

    Thy hand old friend  the service of our
    days

    In differing moods and ways
    May prove to those who follow in our train

    Not valueless nor vain

    Far off and faint as echoes of a dream
    The songs of boyhood seem



    Yet on our autumn boughs unflown with
    spring
    The evening thrushes sing

    The hour draws near howe
    late
    When at the Eternal Gate
    We leave the words and works we call our
    own
    And lift void hands alone

    For love to fill Our nakedness of soul
    Brings to that Gate no toll

    Giftless we come to Him who all things
    gives
    And live because He lives



    POEMS BY ELIZABETH H WHITTIER



    Originally published in the volume entitled
    Hazel Blossoms and accompanied by the fol
    lowing prefatory note

    I have ventured in compliance with the
    desire of dear friends of my beloved sister
    Elizabeth H Whittieh to add to this little
    volume the few poetical pieces which she left
    behind her    These poems with perhaps
    two or three exceptions afford but slight indi
    cations of the inward life of the writer who
    had an almost morbid dread of spiritual and
    intellectual egotism or of her tenderness of
    sympathy chastened mirthfulness and pleas
    ant play of thought and fancy when her shy
    beautiful soul opened like a flower in the
    warmth of social communion In the lines on



    Dr Kane her friends will see something of her
    fine individuality  the rare mingling of deli
    cacy and intensity of feeling which made her
    dear to them This little poem reached Cuba
    while the great explorer lay on his deathbed
    and we are told that he listened with griteful
    tears while it was read to him by his mother

    I am tempted to say more but I write as
    under the eye of her who while with us shrank
    with painful deprecation from the praise or
    mention of performances which seemed so far
    below her ideal of excellence To those who
    best knew her the beloved circle of her inti
    mate friends I dedicate this slight memorial

    THE DREAM OF ARGYLE

    Earthly arms no more uphold him
    Ou his prisons stony floor

    Waiting death in his last slumber
    Lies the doomed MacCallum More

    And he dreams a dream of boyhood

    Rise again his heathery hills
    Sound again the hound

    Cry of moorfowl laugh of rills

    Now he stands amidst his clansmen
    In the low long banquethall

    Over grim ancestral armor
    Sees the ruddy firelight fall

    Once again with pulses beating
    Hears the wandering minstrel tell

    How Montrose on Inverary

    Thieflike from his mountains fell

    Down the glen beyond the castle
    Where the linns swift waters shine

    Round the youthful heir of Argyle
    Shy feet glide and white arms twine

    Fairest of the rustic dancers

    Blueeyed Effie smiles once more



    Bends to him her snooded tresses
    Treads with him the grassy floor

    Now he hears the pipes lamenting
    Harpers for his mother mourn

    Slow with sable plume and pennon
    To her cairn of burial borne

    Then anon his dreams are darker
    Sounds of battle fill his ears

    And the pibroch
    For his fathers fall he hears

    Wild Lochaber
    Wail in concert for the dead

    And Loch Awes deep waters murmur
    For the Campbell

    Fierce and strong the godless tyrants

    Trample the apostate land
    While her poor and faithful remnant

    Wait for the Avengers hand

    Once again at Inverary

    Years of weary exile o
    Armed to lead his scattered clansmen

    Stands the bold MacCallum More

    Once again to battle calling

    Sound the warpipes through the glen j

    POEMS BY ELIZABETH H WHITTIER



    Aud the courtyarfl of Dunstaffnage
    Rings with tread of armed men

    All is lost  The godless triumph
    And the faithful ones and true

    From the scaffold and the prison
    Covenant with God anew

    On the darkness of his dreaming
    Great and sudden glory shone

    Over bonds and death victorious
    s throne

    From the radiant ranks of martyrs
    Notes of joy and praise he hears

    Songs of his poor land
    Sounding from the future years

    Lo he wakes  but airs celestial
    Bathe him in immortal rest

    And he sees with unsealed vision
    Scotlands cause with victory blest

    Shining hosts attend and guard him
    As he leaves his prison door

    And to death as to a triumph
    Walks the great MacCallum More

    Written on the departure of Joseph Sturge
    after his visit to the abolitionists of the United
    States

    Fair islands of the sunny sea  midst all

    rejoicing things
    No more the wailing of the slave a wild

    discordance brings
    On the lifted brows of freemen the tropic

    breezes blow
    The mildew of the bondman

    no more shall know

    How swells from those green islands

    where bird and leaf and flower
    Are praising in their own sweet way the

    dawn of freedoms hour
    The glorious resuri

    rejoicing poured
    s

    regal crown restored

    How beautiful through all the green and
    tranquil summer land



    Uplifted as by miracle the solemn churches
    stand

    The grass is trodden from the paths where
    waiting freemen throng

    Athirst and fainting for the cup of life de
    nied so long

    Oh blessed were the feet of him whose

    generous errand here
    Was to unloose the captive

    the mourners tear
    To lift again the fallen ones a brother

    robber hand
    Had left in pain and wretchedness by the

    waysides of the laud

    The islands of the sea rejoice  the harvest
    anthems rise

    He rests with the immortals  his journey

    has been long
    For him no wail of sorrow but a pjean full

    and strong
    So well and bravely has he done the work

    he found to do
    To justice freedom duty God and man

    forever true

    Strong to the end a man of men from out

    the strife he passed
    The grandest hour of all his life was that

    of earth the last
    Now midst his snowy hills of home to the

    grave they bear him down
    The glory of his fourscore years resting on

    him like a crown

    The mourning of the many bells the
    drooping flags all seem

    Like some dim unreal pageant passing on
    ward in a dream

    And following with the living to his last
    and narrow bed

    Methiuks I see a shadowy band a train of
    noble dead

    T is a strange and weird procession that is
    slowly moving on

    The phantom patriots gathered to the fu
    neral of their son

    In shadowy guise they move along brave
    Otis with hushed tread

    And Warren walking reverently by the
    father of the dead



    Gliding foremost in the misty band a gentle
    jform is there

    In the white robes of the angels and their
    glory round her hair

    She hovers near and bends above her world
    wide honored child

    And the joy that heaven alone can know
    beams on her features mild

    And so they bear him to his grave in the

    fidness of his years
    True sage and prophet leaving us in a time

    of many fears
    Nevermore amid the darkness of our wild

    and evil day
    Shall his voice be heard to cheer us shall

    his finger point the way

    A NOBLE life is in thy care

    A sacred trust to thee is given

    Bright Island  let thy healing air
    Be to him as the breath of Heaven

    The marvel of his daring life
    The selfforgetting leader bold

    Stirs like the trumpet
    A million hearts of meaner mould

    Eyes that shall never meet his own
    Look dim with tears across the sea

    Where from the dark and icy zone

    Sweet Isle of Flowers  he comes to thee

    Fold him in rest O pitying clime

    Give back his wasted strength again
    Soothe with thy endless summer time

    His winterwearied heart and brain

    Sing soft and low thou tropic bird

    From out the fragrant flowery tree

    The ear that hears thee now has heard
    The icebreak of the winter sea

    Through his long watch of awful night
    He saw the Bear in Northern skies

    Now to the Southern Cross of light
    He lifts in hope his weary eyes

    Prayers from the hearts that watched in fear
    When the dark North no answer gave

    s ear
    That still His love may help and save

    Fold thy hands thy work is over

    Cool thy watching eyes with tears
    Let thy poor heart over wearied

    Rest alike from hopes and fears

    Hopes that saw with sleepless vision
    One sad picture fading slow

    Fears that followed vague and nameless
    Lifting back the veils of snow

    For thy brave one for thy lost one
    Truest heart of woman weep

    Owning still the love that granted
    Unto thy beloved sleep

    Not for him that hour of terror
    When the long icebattle o

    In the sunless day his comrades
    Deathward trod the Polar shore

    Spared the cruel cold and famine
    s despair

    Wliat but that could mercy grant him
    What but that has been thy prayer

    Dear to thee that last memorial
    From the cairn beside the sea

    Evermore the month of roses
    Shall be sacred time to thee

    Sad it is the mournful yewtree
    O

    Sad it is the English daisy

    May not blossom on his grave

    But his tomb shall storm and winter
    Shape and fashion year by year

    Pile his mighty mausoleum

    Block by block and tier on tier

    Guardian of its gleaming portal

    Shall his stainless honor be
    While thy love a sweet immortal

    Hovers oer the winter sea

    NIGHT AND DEATH

    The stormwind is howling
    Through old pines afar

    The drear night is falling
    Without moon or star



    The roused sea is lashing

    The bold shore behind
    And the moan of its ebbing

    Keeps time with the wind

    On on through the darkness

    A spectre I pass
    Where like moaning of broken hearts

    Surges the grass

    I see her lone headstone

    T is white as a shroud
    Like a pall hangs above it

    The low drooping cloud

    Who speaks through the dark night

    And lull of the wind
    T is the sound of the pineleaves

    And seawaves behind

    The dead girl is silent

    I stand by her now
    And her pulse beats no quicker

    Nor crimsons her brow

    The small hand that trembled

    When last in my own
    Lies patient and folded

    And colder than stone

    Like the white blossoms falling

    Tonight in the gale
    So she in her beauty

    Sank mournful and pale

    Yet I loved her  I utter

    Such words by her grave
    As I would not have spoken

    Her last breath to save

    Of her love the angels

    In heaven might tell
    While mine would be whispered

    With shudders in hell

    T was well that the white ones

    Who bore her to bliss
    Shut out from her new life

    The vision of this

    Else sure as I stand here

    And speak of my love
    She would leave for my darkness

    Her glory above

    THE MEETING WATERS

    Close beside the meeting waters
    Long I stood as in a dream

    Watching how the little river
    Fell into the broader stream

    Calm and still the mingled current

    Glided to the waiting sea
    On its breast serenely pictured

    Floating cloud and skirting tree

    And I thought  O human spirit

    Strong and deep and pure and blest
    Let the stream of my existence

    Blend with thine and find its rest

    I could die as dies the river

    In that current deep and wide

    I would live as live its waters
    Flashing from a stronger tide



    THE WEDDING VEIL

    Dear Anna when I brought her veil
    Her white veil on her wedding niglit

    Threw oer my thin brown hair its folds

    See Bessie see  you wear at last
    The bridal veil forsworn for years

    She saw my face  her laugh was hushed
    Her happy eyes were filled with tears

    With kindly haste and trembling hand
    She drew away the gauzy mist

    her sweet voice
    said
    Her loving lips my forehead kissed



    We passed from out the searching light

    The summer night was calm and fair
    I did not see her pitying eyes

    I felt her soft hand smooth my hair

    Her tender love unlocked my heart
    Mid falling tears at last 1 said
    Forsworn indeed to me that veil
    Because I only love the dead

    She stood one moment statuestill
    And musing spake in undertone
    The living love may colder grow
    The dead is safe with God alone

    I EARLY AND UNCOLLECTED
    VERSES

    I AM yielding
    cumstances ahuost a necessity in adding to the
    pieces assigned for one reason or another to the
    limbo of an appendix some of my very earliest
    attempts at verse which have been kept alive
    in the newspapers for the last half century
    A few of them have even been printed in book
    form without my consent and greatly to my
    annoyance with all their accumulated errors
    of the press added to their original defects
    and crudity I suppose they should have died
    a natural death long ago bvit tlieir feline te
    nacity of life seems to contradict the theory
    of the  survival of the fittest I have con
    request to take the
    poor vagrants home and give them a more
    presentable appearance in the hope that they
    may at least be of some interest to those who
    are curious enough to note the weak begin
    nings of the graduate of a small country dis
    trict school sixty years ago That they met
    with some degree of favor at that time may be
    accounted for by the fact that tlie makers of
    verse were then few in number with little
    competition in their unprofitable vocation and
    that the standard of criticism was not discour
    agingly high

    The earliest of the author
    found their way into print were published in
    the Newburyport Free Press edited by Wil
    liam Lloyd Garrison in 1S2G The poems
    here collected with the exception of the last
    were written during the years 18251833

    THE EXILES DEPARTURE

    Fond scenes which delighted my youthful ex
    istence
    With feelings of sorrow I bid ye adieu
    A lasting adieu  for now dim in the distance

    The shores of Hibernia recede from my view
    Farewell to the cliffs tempestbeaten and gray
    Which guard the lov
    tive land
    d bay
    The forestcrownd hill and the waterwashd
    strand



    Ive fought for my country  Ive brav
    the dangers
    That throng round the path of the warrior in
    strife
    I now must depart to a nation of strangers

    And pass in seclusion the remnant of life
    Far far from the friends to my bosom most
    dear
    With none to support me in peril and pain
    And none but the stranger to drop the sad tear
    On the grave where the heartbroken Exile is
    lain

    Friends of my youth  I must leave you for
    ever
    And liasten to dwell in a region unknown
    Yet time cannot change nor the broad ocean
    sever
    Hearts firmly united and tried as our own
    Ah no  though I wander all sad and forlorn

    In a far distant land yet sliall memory trace
    When far oer the oceans white surges I m
    borne
    The scene of past pleasures  my ovim native
    place

    Farewell shores of Erin green land of my fa
    thers
    Once more and forever a mournful adieu
    For round thy dim headlands the oceanmist
    gathers
    And shrouds the fair isle I no longer can view
    I go  but wherever my footsteps I bend

    For freedom and peace to my own native isle
    And contentment and joy to each warmhearted
    friend
    Shall be the heart

    THE DEITY

    The Prophet stood
    On the high mount and saw the tempest cloud
    Pour the fierce whirlwind from its reservoir
    Of congregated gloom The mountain oak
    Torn from the earth heaved high its roots

    where once
    s shapely

    form
    Smote by the tempest lashed the mountain

    side
    Yet calm in conscious purity the Seer
    Beheld the awful desolation for
    The Eternal Spirit moved not in the storm

    The tempest ceased The caverned eartliquake

    burst
    Forth from its prison and the mountain rocked
    Even to its base The topmost crags were

    thrown
    With fearfid crashing down its shuddering

    sides
    Unawed the Prophet saw and heard  he felt
    Not in the earthquake moved the God of

    Heaven
    The murmur died away  and from the height
    Torn by the storm and shattered by the shock
    1 1 ose far and clear a pyramid of flame
    Mighty and vast  the startled mountain deer
    Shrank from its glare and cowered within the

    The wild fowl shrieked  but even then the

    Seer
    Untrembling stood and marked the fearful

    glow
    For Israels God came not within the flame

    The fiery beacon sank A still small voice
    Unlike to human sound at once conveyed
    Deep awe and reverence to his pious heart
    Then bowed the holy man  his face he veiled
    Within his mantle  and in meekness owned
    The presence of his God discerned not in
    The storm the earthquake or the mighty
    flame



    THE VALE OF THE MERRIMAC

    There are streams which are famous in his
    torys stoiy
    Whose names are famihar to pen and to
    tongue
    Renowned in the records of love and of glory
    Where knighthood has ridden and minstrels
    have sung
    Fair streams thro
    gliding
    Tower temple and palace their borders
    adorning
    With tallmasted ships on their broad bosoms
    riding
    Their banners stretchd out in the breezes of
    morning
    And their vales may be lovely and pleasant
    but never
    Was skiff ever wafted or wav
    Oer a lovelier wave than my dear native river
    Or brighter tides rolld than in Merrimacs
    vale

    And fair streams may glide where the climate
    is milder
    Vlee winter ne
    blooms
    And others may roll where the region is wilder
    s deep
    gloom
    Where the thunderscath
    are frowning
    And the Rhines rapid waters encircle their
    bases



    Where the snows of long years are the hoary
    Alps crowning
    And the tempestcharg
    embraces
    d amid scenery so
    frightful
    The region of romance and wild fairytale
    But such scenes coidd not be to my heart so de
    lightful
    As the home of my fathers  fair Merrimac
    vale

    There are streams where the bounty of Provi
    dence musters
    The fairest of fruits by their warm sunny
    sides
    s heavy
    clusters
    And the orangetree waving its fruit o
    their tides
    But I envy not him whose lot has been cast
    there
    For oppression is there  and the hand of the
    spoiler
    Regardless of justice or mercy has past there
    And made him a wretched and indigent
    toiler
    No  dearer to me are the scenes of my child
    hood
    The mosscoverd bank and the breezewafted
    sail
    The agestinted oak and the green groves of
    wildwood
    That wave round the borders of Merrimac
    vale

    Oh lovely the scene when the gray misty vapor

    When the firefly lighting his wild gleaming
    taper
    Thy dimly seen lowlands comes glimmering
    o
    When on thy calm surface the moonbeam falls
    brightly
    And the dull bird of night is his covert for
    saking
    When the whippoorwills notes from thy mar
    gin sound lightly
    And break on the sound which thy small
    waves are making
    O brightest of visions  my heart shall forever
    Till memory shall perish and reason shall fail
    8till preference give to my own native river
    The name of my fathers and Merrimac

    And the boldest shook to hear

    d up

    In the torchliylit cukl and tlim
    And the priest let fall his iucensecup

    And the virgin hushed her hymn
    For a boding clash and a clanging tramp

    And a summoning voice were heard
    And fretted wall and dungeon damp

    To the fearful echo stirred

    The peasant heard the sound

    As he sat beside his hearth
    And the song and the dance were hushed around

    With the fireside tale of mirth
    The chieftain shook in his banner

    As the sound of fear drew nigli
    And the warder shrank from the castle wall

    As the gleam of spears went by

    Woe  woe  to the stranger then

    At the feast and flow of wine
    In the red array of mailed men

    Or bowed at the holy shrine
    For the wakened pride of an injured land

    Had buist its iron thrall
    From the plumed chief to the pilgrim band

    Woe  woe  to the sons of Gaul

    Proud beings fell tliat liour

    With the young and passing fair
    And the flame went up from dome and tower

    The avengers arm was there
    The stranger priest at the altar stood

    And clasped his beads in prayer
    But the holy shrine grew dim with blood

    The avenger found him there

    Woe  woe  to the sons of Gaul

    To the serf and maile 1 lord
    They were gathered darkly one and all

    To the harvest of the sword
    And the morning sun with a quiet smile

    Shone out o
    n ruined temple and smouldering pile

    And the ghastly forms of men

    Ay the sunshine sweetly smiled

    As its early glance came forth
    It had no sympathy with the wild

    And terrible tilings of earth
    And the man of blood that day might read

    In a language freely given
    How ill his dark and midnight deed

    Became the calm of Heaven



    THE SPIRIT OF THE NORTH

    Spirit of the frozen North

    Where the wave is chained and still
    And the savage bear looks forth

    Nightly from his caverned hill



    Down from thy eternal throne

    From thy land of cloud and storm

    Where the meeting icebergs groan
    Sweepeth on thy wratbful form

    Spirit of the frozen wing

    Dweller of a voiceless clime
    Where no coming on of spring

    Gilds the weary course of time
    Monarch of a realm untrod

    By the restless feet of men
    Where alone the hand of God

    Mid his mighty works hath been I

    Throned amid the ancient hills

    Pded with undeeaying snow
    Flashing with the path of rills

    Frozen m their first glad flow
    Thou hast seen the gloomy north

    Gleaming with unearthly light
    Spreading its pale banners forth

    Checkered with the stars of night

    Thou hast gazed untrembling where

    Giant forms of flame were driven
    Like the spirits of the air

    Striding up the vault of heaven
    Thou hast seen that midnight glow

    Hiding moon and star and sky
    And the icy hills below

    Reddening to the fearful dye

    Dark and desolate and lone

    Curtained with the tempestcloud
    Drawn around thy ancient throne

    Like oblivion
    Dim and distantly the sun

    Glances on thy palace walLs
    But a shadow cold and dun

    Broods along its pillared haUs

    Lord of sunless depths and cold

    Chainer of the northern sea
    At whose feet the storm is rolled

    Who hath power to humble thee
    Spirit of the stormy north

    Bow thee to thy Makers nod
    Bend to him who sent thee forth

    Servant of the living God



    THE EARTHQUAKE

    Calmly the night came down
    Oer Scyllas shatter

    How desolate that silent town
    How tenantless the halls

    Where yesterday her thousands trod

    And princes graced their proud abode

    Low on the wet sea sand

    Humbled in anguish now
    The despot midst his menial band

    Bent down his kingly brow
    And prince and peasant knelt in prayer
    For grief had made them equal there

    Again as at the mom

    The earthquake rolld its car

    Lowly the castletowers were borne
    That mock

    d brow

    Went down among the waves below

    Up rose the kneelers then

    As the wave

    The horror of those fated men
    Was uttered by no word

    But closer still the mother prest

    The infant to her faithful breast

    One long wild shriek went up

    Full mighty in despair
    As bowd to drink death

    The thousands gathered there
    And mans strong wail and woman
    Blent as the waters hurried by

    On swept the whelming sea

    The mountains felt its shock
    As the long cry of agony

    Thrills thro their towers of rock
    An echo round that fatal shore
    The death wail of the sufferers bore

    The morning sun shed forth

    Its Ught upon the scene
    Where tower and palace strew

    With wrecks of what had been
    But of the thousands who were gone
    No trace was left no vestige shown

    JUDITH AT THE TENT OF HOLO
    FERNES

    Night was down among the mountains

    In her dim and quiet manner
    Where Bethulias silver fountains

    Gushed beneath the Assyrian banner
    Mooidight o

    As a mighty flag unfurled
    Like an angels snowy pinion

    Resting on a darkened world

    Faintly rose the city

    But the crowded camp was calm
    Girded in their battle armor

    Each a falchion at his arm
    Lordly chief and weary vassal

    In the arms of slumber fell
    It had been a day of wassail

    And the wine had circled well

    Underneath his proud pavilion

    Lay Assyrias champion
    Where the rubv

    Shone beside the berylstone
    With imperial purpl laden

    Breathing in the perfumed air
    Dreams he of the Jewish maiden

    With her dark and jewelled hair

    Wlio is she the palebrowed stranger
    Bending oer that sou of slaughter



    God be with thee in thy danger
    Israel

    She hath bared her queenly beauty
    To the dark Assyrians glance

    Now a high and sterner duty
    Bids her to his couch advance

    Beautiful and pale she bendeth

    Li her earnest prayer to Heaven
    Look again that maiden standeth

    In the strength her God has given
    Strangely is her dark eye kindled

    Hot blood through her cheek is poured
    Lo her every fear hath dwindled

    And her hand is on the sword

    Upward to the flashing curtain

    See that mighty blade is driven
    And its fall

    As the cloudfires track in heaven
    Down as with a power supernal

    Twice the lifted weapon fell
    Twice his slumber is eternal

    Who shall wake the infidel

    Sunlight on the mountains streameth

    Like an airborne wave of gold
    And Betliulia

    Round Judeas bannerfold
    Down they go the mailed warriors

    As the upper torrents sally
    Headlong from their mountainbarriers

    Down upon the sleeping valley

    Rouse thee from thy couch Assyrian

    Dream no more of woman
    Fiercer than the leaguered Tyiian

    Or the darkbrowed sons of Nile
    Foes are on thy slumber breaking

    Chieftain to thy battle rise
    Vain the call  he will not waken

    Headless on his couch he lies

    Who liath dimmed your boasted glory

    What hath womans weakness done
    Whose dark brow is up before ye

    Blackening in the fiercehaued sun
    Lo  an eye that never slumbers

    Looketh in its vengeance down

    The forestopenings grew more dim
    As glimpses of the arching bhie
    And waking stars came softly through
    The rifts of many a giant limb
    Above the wet and tangled swamp
    White vapors gathered thick and damp
    And through their cloudy curtaining
    Flapped many a brown and dusky wing
    Pinions that fan the moonless dun
    But fold them at the rising sun

    Beneath the closing veil of night

    And leafy bough and curling fog
    With his few warriors ranged in sight
    Scarred relics of his latest fight

    Rested the fiery Wanipanoag
    He leaned upon his loaded gun
    Warm with its recent wvuk of death
    And save the struggling of his breath
    That slow and hard and longrepressed
    Shook the damp folds around his breast
    An eye that was unused to scan
    The sterner moods of that dark man
    Had deemed his tall and silent form
    With hidden passion fierce and warm
    With that fixed eye as still and dark
    As clouds which veil their lightning spark
    That of some forestchampion
    Whom sudden death had passed upon
    A giant frozen into stone
    Son of the throned iSachem   Thou
    The sternest of the forest kings
    Shall the scorned paleone trample now
    Unambushed on thy mountain
    Yea diive his vile and hated plough

    Among thy nations holy things
    Crushing the warriorskeleton
    In scorn beneath his armed heel
    And not a hand be left to deal
    A kindred vengeance fiercely back
    And cross in blood the Spoiler

    He turned him to his trustiest one
    The old and wartried Annawon
    Brother
    In hushed and listening attitude
    This night the VisionSpirit hath

    Unrolled the scroll of fate before me
    And ere the suniise eometh Death

    Will wave his dusky pinion oer me
    Nay start not  well I know thy faith
    Thy weapon now may keep its shcatli
    But when the bodeful morning breaks
    And the green forest widely wakes

    IJnto the roar of English thunder
    Then trusted brother be it thine
    To burst upon the foemans line
    And rend his serried strength asunder
    Perchance thyself and yet a few
    Of faithful ones may struggle through
    And rallying on tlie wooded plain
    Strike deep for vengeance once again
    And ofier up in paleface blood
    An offering to the Indians God

    A musket shot  a sharp quick yell
    And then tlie stified groan of pain



    Told that another red man fell
    And blazed a sudden light again
    Across that kingly brow and eye
    Like lightning on a clouded sky
    And a low growl like that which thrills
    The hunter of the Eastern hills

    Burst through clenched teeth and rigid lip
    And when the great chief spoke again
    His deep voice shook beneath its rein
    As wrath and grief held fellowship

    Brother  methovight when as but now

    I pondered on my nations wrong
    With sadness on his shadowy brow

    My fathers spirit passed along
    He iointed to the far southwest

    Where sunsets gold was growing dim

    And seemed to beckon me to him
    And to the forests of the blest
    My father loved the white men when
    They were but children shelteiless
    For his great spirit at distress
    Melted to womans tenderness
    Nor was it given him to know

    That children whom he cherished then

    Would rise at length like armed men
    To work his peoples overthrow
    Yet thus it is   the God before

    Whose awful shrine the pale ones bow
    Hath frowned upon and given oer

    The red man to the stranger now
    A few more moons and there will be
    No gathering to the council tree
    The scorched earth  the blackened log

    The naked bones of warriors slain

    Be the sole relies which remain
    Of the once mighty Waiiiijanoag
    The forests of our Inintiiigland

    With all their old and solemn green
    Will bow before the Spoilers axe
    The plough displace the hunters tracks
    And the tall prayerhouse steeple stand

    Where the Great Spirits shrine hath been 1

    Yet brother from this awful hour

    The dying curse of Metacom
    Shall linger with abiding power

    Upon the spoilers of my home

    The fearful veil of things to come

    By Kitchtan
    The shadows of the embryo years

    And I can see more clearly through
    Than ever visioned Powwah did
    For all the future comes unbid

    Yet welcome to my tranced view
    As battleyell to warriorears
    From stream and lake and huntinghill

    Our tribes may vanish like a dream

    And even ray dark curse may seem
    Like idle winds when Heaven is still

    No bodeful harbinger of ill
    But fiercer than the downright thunder
    Wlien yawns the nionntainrock asunder

    Shall pour a darker tide than rain
    The sea shall catch its bloodred stain
    And broadly on its banks shall gleam

    The steel of those who should be brothers
    Yea those whom one fond parent nursed
    Shall meet in strife like tiends accursed
    And trample down the once loved form
    While yet with breathing assion warm

    As fiercely as they would another

    The morning star sat dimly on
    The lighted eastern horizon
    The deadly glare of levelled gun

    Came streaking through the twilight haze

    And naked to its reddest blaze
    A hundred warriors sprang in view

    One dark red arm was tossed on high
    One giant shout came hoarsely through

    The clangor and the charging cry
    Just as across the scattering gloom
    Red as the naked hand of Doom

    Tlie English volley hurtled by
    The arm  the voice of Metacom

    One piercing shriek  one vengeful yell

    MOUNT AGIOCHOOK

    The Indians supposed the White Mountains
    were the residence of powerful spirits and in
    consequence rarely ascended them

    Gray searcher of the upper air

    There s sunshine on thy ancient walls
    A crown upon thy forehead bare

    A flash upon thy waterfalls
    A rainbow glory in the cloud

    Upon thine awful summit bowed
    The radiant ghost of a dead storm

    And music from the leafy slii
    Which swathes in green thy giant form

    Mellowed and softened from above
    Steals downward to the lowland ear

    Sweet as the first fond dream of love
    s ear

    The time has been white giant when

    Thy shadows veiled the red man
    And over crag and serpent den
    And wild gorge where the steps of men

    In chase or battle might not come
    The mountain eagle bore on high

    The emblem of the free of soul
    And midway in the fearful sky
    Sent back the Indian battle cry

    s roll

    The wigwam fires have all burned out
    Tlie moccasin has left no track

    Nor wolf nor panther roam about
    The Saco and the Merrimac

    And thou that liftest up on high

    Thy mighty barriers to the sky
    Art not the haimted mount of old

    Where on each crag of blasted stone



    Some dreadful spirit found his throne
    And hid within the thick cloud fold
    Heard only in the thunder
    s flash
    When crumbled rock and riven branch
    Went down before the avalanclie

    No more that spirit nioveth there

    The dwellers of the vale are dead
    No hunter

    No dry leaf rustles to his tread
    The paleface climbs thy tallest rock
    His hands thy crystal gates unlock
    From steep to steep his maidens call
    Light laughing like the streams that fall
    In music down thy rocky wall
    And only when their careless tread
    Lays bare an Indian arrowhead
    Spent and forgetful of the deer
    Tliink of the race that perished here

    Oh sacred to the Indian seer

    Gray altar of the men of old
    Not vainly to the listening ear

    The legends of thy past are told
    Tales of the downward sweeping flood
    ancient wood
    f armed hands and spectral forms
    Of giants in their leafy shroud
    And voices calling long and loud
    In the dread pauses of thy storms
    For still within their caverned home
    Dwell the strange gods of heathendom

    THE FAIR QUAKERESS

    She was a fair young girl yet on her brow
    No pale pearl shone a blemish on the pure
    And snowy lustre of its living light
    No radiant gem shone beautifully tlirough
    The shadowing of her tresses as a star
    Through the dark sky of midnight  and no

    wreath
    Of coral circled on her queenly neck
    In mockery of the glowing cheek and lip
    Whose hue the fairy guardian of the flowers
    Miglit never rival whiii licr delicate touch
    Tinges the rose of springtime

    Unadorned
    have by her youthful charms and with a garb
    Simple as Natiues self why turn to her
    The proud and gifted and the versed in aU
    The pageantry of fashion

    She hath not
    Moved down the dance to music when the hall
    Is lighted up like sunsliine and the thrill
    Of the liglit viol and the mellow flute
    And the deep tones of manhood softened down
    To very music nielt upon the ear
    She has not mingled with the hollow world
    Nor tampered with its mockeries until all
    The delicate perceptions of the heart
    The innate modesty the watchful sense
    Of maiden dignity are lost within
    The maze of fashion and the din of crowds

    Yet Beauty hath its homage Kings have

    bowed
    From the tall majesty of ancient thrones
    With a prostrated knee yea cast aside
    The awfulness of timecreated power



    For the regardful glances of a child
    Yea the high ones and powerful of Earth
    The helmed sons of victory the grave
    And schooled philosoihers the giant meu
    Of overmastering intellect have turned
    Each from the separate idol of his high
    And vehement ambition for the low
    Idolatry of human loveliness
    Ami lintred the sublimity of mind
    Tlir godlike and commanding intellect
    Which nations knelt to for a woman
    s smile

    And in the chastened beauty of that eye

    And ill the bcauritul play iif that red lip

    And in the quiet sniilu and in the voice

    Sweet as the tuneful greeting of a bird

    To tlie first flowers of springtime there is more

    Than the perfection of the painter

    Or statuarys moulding Mind is there

    The pure and holy attributes of soul

    The seal of virttie the excvediug grace

    Of meekness blended with a maiden pride

    Nor deem ye that beneath the gentle smile

    And tlie calm temper of a chastened mind

    No warmth of passion kindles and no tide

    Of quick and earnest feeling courses on

    From the warm heart

    springs
    Of deep and pure afPeetion hidden now
    Within tiiat quiet bosom which but wait
    The thrilling of some kindly touch to flow
    Like waters from the Desertrock of old

    As from the snows with battle red died out the

    sinking sun
    And broad and vast beneath him lay a world

    for freedom won

    How died that victor  In the field with ban
    ners oer him thrown

    With trumpets in his failing ear by charging
    squadrons blown

    With scattered foemeu flying fast and fearfully
    before him

    With shouts of triumph swelling round and
    brave men bending o

    Not on his fields of victory nor in his council

    The worn and sorrowing leader heard the inev
    itable call

    Alone he perished in the land he saved from
    slaverjrs ban

    Maligned and doubted and denied a broken
    hearted man

    Now let the New World

    the fallen chief

    with tears of grief

    ISABELLA OF AUSTRIA

    Isabella Infanta of Parma and consort of
    Joseph of Austria predicted her own deatli
    e with the Em
    peror Amidst the gayety and splendor of
    Vienna and Presbuig she was reserved and
    melancholy  she believed that Heaven had
    given her a view of the future and that her
    child the namesake of the great Maria The
    resa would perish with her Her prediction
    was fulfilled

    Midst the palace bowers of Hungary imperial

    Presburgs pride
    With the noble born and beautiful assembled

    at her side
    She stood beneath the summer heavens the soft

    wind sighing on
    Stirring the green and arching boughs like

    dancers in the sun
    The beautiful pomegranate flower the snowy

    orange bloom
    The lotus and the trailing vine the rose

    meek perfume



    s

    marble hair
    All that might charm the fresli young sense or

    light the soul was there

    But she a monarch

    gloomily apart
    With lier dark eyes tearfully cast down and

    a shadow on her heart
    Young beautiful and dearly loved what sorrow

    hath she known
    Are not the hearts and swords of all held

    sacred as her own
    Is not her lord the kingliest in battlefield or

    tower
    The wisest in the councilhall the gayest in

    the bower
    Is not his love as full and deep as his own

    Danubes tide
    And wherefore in her princely home weeps

    Isabel his bride

    She raised her jewelled hand and flung her

    veiling tresses back
    Bathing its snowy tapering within their glossy

    black
    A tear fell on the orange leaves rich gem and

    mimic blossom
    And fringed robe shook fearfully upon her

    sighing bosom
    Smile on smile on she murmured low

    for all is joy around
    Shadow and sunslune stainless sky soft airs

    and blossomed ground
    Tis meet the light of heart should smile

    when natures smile is fair
    And melody and fragrance meet twin sisters

    of the air

    But ask me not to share with you the beauty

    of the scene
    The fountainfall mosaic walk and breadths

    of tender green
    And point not to the mild blue sky or glorious

    summer sun
    I know how very fair is all the hand of God

    has done
    The hills the sky the sunlit cloud the waters

    leaping forth
    The swaying trees the scented flowers the

    dark green robes of earth
    I love them well but I have learned to turn

    aside from all
    And nevermore my heart must own their

    sweet but fatal tlirall

    And I could love the noble one whose mighty
    name I bear

    And closer to my breaking heart his princely
    image wear

    And I could love our sweet young flower un
    folding day by day

    And taste of that imearthly joy which mothers
    only may

    But what am I to cling to these   A voice is
    in my ear

    A shadow lingers at my side the deathwail

    and the bier
    The cold and starless night of Death where

    day may never beam
    The silence and iorgetfulness the sleep that

    hath no dream

    O God to leave this fair bright world and
    more than all to know

    The moment when the Spectral One shall
    strike his fearful blow

    To know the day the very hour to feel the
    tide roll on

    To shudder at the gloom before and weep the
    sunshine gone

    To count tht days the few short days of light
    and love and breath

    Between me and the noisome grave the voice
    less home of death

    Alas   if feeling knowing this I murmur at
    my doom

    Let not thy frowning my God  lend dark
    ness to the tomb

    Oh I have borne my spirit up and smiled

    amidst the chill
    Remembrance of my certain doom which lin
    gers with me still
    I would not cloud my fair childs brow nor let

    a teardrop dim
    The eye that met my wedded lords lest it

    should sadden him
    But there are moments when the strength of

    feeling must have way
    That hidden Ude of unnamed woe nor fear nor

    love can stay
    Smile on smile on lighthearted ones  Your

    sun of joy is high
    Smile on and leave the doomed of Heaven

    alone to weep and die

    A funeral chant was wailing through Viennas

    holy pile
    A cofn with its gorgeous pall was borne along

    the aisle
    The drooijing flags of many lands waved slow

    above the dead
    A mighty band of mourners came a king was

    at its head
    A youthful king with mournful tread and

    dim and tearful eye
    He scarce had dreamed that one so pure as his

    fair bride could die
    And sad and long above the throng the funeral

    anthem rung
    Mourn for the hope of Austria Mourn for

    the loved and young

    The wail went up from other lands the valleys
    of the Hun

    Fair Parnia with its orange bowers and hills of
    vine and sun

    The lilies of imperial France drooped as the
    sound went by

    The long lament of cloistered Spain was min
    gled with the cry



    The dwellers in Colornos halls the Slowak at

    his cave
    The bowed at the Escurial the Magyar stoutly

    brave
    All wept the early stricken flower  and still

    the anthem rung
    Mourn for the pride of Austria Mourn for

    the loved and young



    THE FRATRICIDE

    He stood on the brow of the wellknown hill
    Its few gray oaks moand over him still
    The last of that forest which east the gloom
    Of its shadow at eve oer his childhoods home
    And the beautiful valley beneath him lay
    With its quivering leaves and its streams at

    play
    And the sunshine over it all the while
    Like the golden shower of the Eastern isle

    He knew the rock with its fingering vine
    And its gray top touchd by the slant sunshine
    And the delicate stream which crept beneath
    Soft as the flow of an infants breath
    And the flowers which leand to the West

    winds sigh
    Kissing each ripple which glided by
    And he knew every valley and wooded swell
    For the visions of childhood are treasured well

    Why shook the old man as his eye glanced down
    That narrow ravine where the rude cliffs frown
    With their shaggy brows and their teeth of

    stone
    And their grim shade back from the sunlight

    thrown
    Wliat saw he there save the dreary glen
    Where the shy fox crept from the eye of men
    And the great owl sat on the leafy limb
    That the hateful sun might not look on him

    Fixd glassy and strange was that old mans

    eye
    As if a spectre were stealing by
    And glared it still on that narrow dell
    Where thicker and browner the twilight fell
    Yet at every sigh of the fitful wind
    Or stirring of leaves in the wood behind
    His wild glance wanderd the landscape oer
    Then fixd on that desolate dell once more

    Oh who shall tell of the thoughts which ran
    Through the dizzied brain of that gray old

    man
    His childhoods home and his fathers toil
    And his sisters kiss and his mothers smile
    And his brothers laughter and gamesome mirth
    At the village school and the winter hearth
    The beautiful thoughts of his early time
    Ere his heart grew dark with its later crime

    And darker and wilder his visions came
    Of the deadly feud and the midnight flame
    Of the Indians knife with its slaughter red
    I Of the ghastly forms of the scalpless dead

    APPENDIX



    Of his own fierce deeds in that fearful hour
    When the terrible Brandt was forth in power
    And he claspd his hands oer his burning eye
    To shadow the vision which glided by

    It came with the rush of the battlestorm
    With a brothers shaken and kneeling form
    And his prayer for life when a brothers arm
    Was lifted above him for mortal harm
    And the fiendish curse and the groan of death
    And the welling of blood and the gurgling

    breath
    And the scalp torn off while each nerve could

    feel
    The wrenching hand and the jagged steel

    And the old man groan d  for he saw again

    The mangled corse of his kinsman slain

    As it lay where his hand had hurld it then

    At the shadowd foot of that fearful glen

    And it rose erect with the deathpang grim

    And pointed its bloodied finger at him

    And his heart grew cold  and the curse of

    Cain
    Bum d like a fire in the old mans brain

    Oh had he not seen that spectre rise
    On the blue of the cold Canadian skies
    From the lakes which sleep in the ancient

    wood
    It had risen to whisper its tale of blood
    And followd his bark to the sombre shore
    And glared by night through the wigwam door
    And here on his own familiar hill
    It rose on his haunted vision still

    Whose corse was that which the morrows

    sun
    Through the opening boughs lookd calmly

    on
    There were those who bent oer that rigid face
    Who well in its darkend lines might trace
    The features of him who a traitor fled
    From a brother whose blood himself had shed
    And there on the spot where he strangely died
    They made the grave of the Fratricide



    ISABEL

    I DO not love thee Isabel and yet thou art

    most fair
    I know the tempting of thy lips the witchcraft

    of thy hair
    The winsome smile that might beguile the shy

    bird from his tree
    But from their spell I know so well I shake my

    manhood free

    I might have loved thee Isabel  I know I
    should if aught

    Of all thy words and ways had told of one un
    selfish thought

    K through the cloud of fashion the pictured
    veil of art

    One casual flash had broken warm earnest
    from the heart



    But words are idle Isabel and if I praise or

    blame
    Or cheer or warn it matters not  thy life will

    be the same
    Still free to use and still abuse Unmindful of

    the harm
    The fatal gift of beauty the power to choose

    and charm

    Then go thy way fair Isabel nor heed that

    from thy train
    A doubtful follower falls away enough will still

    remain
    But what the longrebuking years may bring to

    them or thee
    No prophet and no jirophets son am I to guess

    or see

    I do not love thee Isabel  I would as soon put

    on
    A crown of slender frost  work beneath the

    heated sun
    Or chase the winds of summer or trust the

    sleeping sea
    Or lean upon a shadow as think of loving thee



    STANZAS

    Bind up thy tresses thou beautiful one
    Of brown in the shadow and gold in the sun
    Free should their delicate lustre be thrown
    Oer a forehead more pure than the Parian

    stone
    Shaming the light of those Orient pearls
    Which bind oer its whiteness thy soft wreath
    ing curls

    Smile for thy glance on the mirror is thrown
    And the face of an angel is meeting thine

    own
    Beautiful creature I marvel not
    That thy cheek a lovelier tint hath caught
    And the kindling light of thine eye hath told
    Of a dearer wealth than the misers gold

    Away away there is danger here

    A terrible phantom is bending near

    Ghastly and sunken his rayless eye

    Scowls on thy loveliness scornfully

    With no human look with no human breath

    He stands beside thee the haunter Death

    Fly  but alas  he will follow still
    Like a moonlight shadow beyond thy will
    In thy noonday walk in thy midnight sleep
    Close at thy hand will that phantom keep
    Still in thine ear shall his whispers be
    Woe that such phantom should follow thee

    In the lighted hall where the dancers go

    Like beautiful spirits to and fro

    When thy fair arms glance in their stainless

    white
    Like ivory bathed in still moonlight
    And not one star in the holy sky
    Hath a clearer light than thine own blue eye 1

    Is the ripple follows the bark at sea
    n the softend light in the turning dance
    Je will fix on thine his dead cold glance
    The chill of his breath on thy cheek shall hnger
    Vnd thy warm blood shrink from his icy finger 1

    Awhile thy soul is open as thy brow

    MOGG MEGONE

    This poem was commenced in 1830 but
    id not assume its present shape until four
    ears after It deals with the border strife of
    he early settlers of eastern New England and
    tieir savage neighbors  but its personages
    ad incidents are mainly fictitious Looking

    it at the present time it suggests lhe idea
    a big Indian in his warpaint strutting

    out in Sir Walter Scotts plaid



    HO stands on that cliff like a figrure of stone
    Unraoving and tall in the light of the sky
    Wliere the spray of the cataract sparkles on
    high
    ionely and sternly save Mogg Megone
    lose to the verge of the rock is he
    While beneath him the Saco its work is do
    ing
    urrying down to its grave the sea
    And slow through the rock its pathway hew
    ing
    ar down through the mist of the falling river
    Vhich rises up like an incense ever
    he splintered points of the crags are seen
    Vith water howling and vexed between
    Vhile the scooping whirl of the pool beneath
    ieems an open throat with its granite teeth

    Jut Mogg Megone never trembled yet

    Vherever his eye or his foot was set

    le is watchful each form in the moonlight

    dim
    f rock or of tree is seen of him



    He listens  each sound from afar is cavight

    The faintest shiver of leaf and limb

    But he sees not the waters which foam and

    fret
    Whose moonlit spray has his moccasin wet
    And the roar of their rushing he hears it not

    The moonlight through the open bough

    Of the gnarld beech whose naked root

    Coils like a serpent at his foot
    Falls checkered on the Indians brow
    His head is bare save only where
    Waves in the wind one lock of hair

    Reserved for him whoeer he be
    More mighty than Megone in strife

    Wlien breast to breast and knee to knee
    Above the fallen warriors life
    Gleams quick and keen the scalplngknife

    Megone hath his knife and hatchet and gun
    And his gaudy and tasselled blanket on
    His knife hath a handle with gold inlaid
    And magic words on its polished blade
    T was the gift of Castine to Mogg Megone
    For a scalp or twain from the Yjngees torn
    His gun was the gift of the Tarrantiue

    And Modocawandos wives had strung
    The brass and the beads which tinkle and shine
    On the polished breach and broad bright line

    Of beaded wampum around it hung

    What seeks Megone  His foes are near
    Grey Jocelyns eye is never sleeping

    And the garrison lights are buining clear
    Where Philips men their watch are keeping

    Let him hie him away through the dank river

    Never rustling the boughs nor displacing the

    rocks
    For the eyes and the ears which are watching

    for Mogg
    Are keener than those of the wolf or the fox

    He starts  there s a rustle among the leaves

    Another  the click of his gun is heard
    A footsliep  is it the step of Cleaves

    With Indian blood on his English sword
    Steals Harmon down from the sands of York
    With hand of iron and foot of cork
    Has Scamman versed in Indian wile
    For vengeance left his vinehung isle
    Hark  at that whistle soft and low

    How lights the eye of Mogg Megone
    A smile gleams oer his dusky brow

    Boon welcome Johnny Boniton

    Out steps with cautious foot and slow
    And quick keen glances to and fro

    The hunted outlaw Boniton
    A low lean swarthy man is he
    With blanketgarb and buskined knee

    And naught of English fashion on
    For he hates the race from whence he sprung
    And he couches his words in the Indian tongue

    Hush  let the Sachems voice be weak
    The waterrat shall hear him speak

    APPENDIX



    The owl shall whoop in the white mans ear
    Tliat Mogg Megone with his scalps is here
    He pauses  dark over cheek and brow
    A flush as of shaiue is stealing now
    Sachem   he says  let me have the land
    Which stretches away iipon either hand
    As far about as my feet can stray
    In the half of a gentle summers day

    From the leaping brook to the Saco river
    And the fair  haired girl thon hast sought of

    me
    Shall sit in the Sachems wigwam and be

    The wife of Mogg Megone forever

    There s a sudden light in the Indians glance
    A moments trace of powerful feeling

    Of love or triumph or both percliance
    Over his proud calm features stealing

    The words of my fatlier are very good

    He shall have the land antl water and wood

    And he who harms the Sagnumre John

    Shall feel the knife of Mogg Megone

    But the fawn of the Yengees shall sleep on my
    breast

    And the bird of the clearing shall sing in my
    nest

    But father    and the Indians hand

    Falls gently on tlie white mans arm
    And with a smile as shrewdly bland

    As the deep voice is slow and calm
    Where is my fathers singingbird

    The sunny eye and sunset hair
    I know I liave my fathers word

    And that his word is good and fair

    But will my fatlier tell me where
    Megone shall go and look for his bride
    For he sees her not by her fathers side

    The dark stern eye of Boniton

    Flashes over the features of Mogg Megone
    In one of those glances which searcli within

    But the stolid calm of the Indian alone

    Remains where the trace of emotion has been

    Does the Sachem doubt Let him go with
    me

    And the eyes of the Sachem his bride shall see

    Cautious and slow with pauses oft
    And watchful eyes and whispers soft
    The twain are stealing through the wood
    Leaving the downwardrushing flood
    Whose deep and solemn roar behind
    Grows fainter on the evening wind

    Hark   is that the angry howl

    Of the wolf the hills among
    Or the hooting of the owl

    On his leafy cradle swung
    Quickly glancing to and fro
    Listening to each sound they go
    Round the columns of the pine

    Indistinct in shadow seeming
    Like some old and pillared shrine
    With the soft and white moonshine
    Round the foliagetracery shed
    Of each columns branching head



    For its lamps of worship gleaming
    And the sounds awakened there

    In the pineleaves fine and small

    Soft and sweetly musical
    By the fingers of the air
    For the anthems dying fall
    Lingering round some temples wall
    Nielie and cornice round and round
    Wailing like the ghost of sound
    Is not Natures worship thus

    Ceaseless ever going on
    Hath it not a voice for us

    In the thunder or the tone
    Of the leafharp faint and small

    Speaking to the unseal d ear

    Words of blended love aud fear
    Of the mighty Soul of all

    Naught had the twain of thoughts like these
    As they wound along through the crowded trees
    Where never had rung the axemans stroke
    On the gnarled trunk of the rough  barked

    oak
    Climbing the dead trees mossy log

    Breaking the mesh of the bramble fine

    Turning aside the wild grapevine
    And lightly crossing the quaking bog
    Whose surface shakes at the leap of the frog
    And out of whose pools the ghostly fog

    CreeiJS into the chill moonshine

    Yet even that Indians ear had heard
    The preaching of the Holy Word
    Sanchekantackets isle of sand
    Was once his fathers hunting land
    Where zealous Hiacoomes stood
    The wild apostle of the wood
    Shook from his soul the fear of harm
    And trampled on the Powwaws charm
    Until the wizards curses hung
    Suspended on his palsying tongue
    And the fierce warrior grim and tall
    Trembled before the forest Paul

    A cottage hidden in the wood

    Red through its seams a light is glowing
    On rock and bovigh and treetrunk rude

    A narrow lustre throwing
    Who s there   a clear firm voice demands

    Hold Ruth  tis I the Sagamore
    Quick at the summons hasty hands

    Unclose the bolted door
    And on the outlaws daughter shine
    The flashes of the kindled pine

    Tall and erect the maiden stands

    Like some young priestess of the wood
    The freebom child of Solitude
    And bearing still the wild and rvide
    Yet noble trace of Natures hands
    Her dark brown cheek has caught its stain
    More from the sunshine than the rain
    Yet where her long fair hair is parting
    A pure white brow into light is starting
    And where the folds of her blanket sever
    Are neck and a bosom as white as ever
    The foamwreaths rise on the leaping river

    But in the convulsive quiver and grip
    Of the muscles around her bloodless lip

    There is something painful and sad to see
    And her eye has a glance more sternly wild
    Than even that of a forest child

    In its fearless and untamed freedom should
    be
    Yet seldom in hall or court are seen
    So queenly a form and so noble a mien

    As freely and smiling she welcomes them
    there
    Her outlawed sire and Mogg Megone

    Pray father how does thy hunting fare

    And Sachem say  does Scamman wear
    In spite of thy promise a scalp of his own
    Hurried and light is the maidens tone

    But a fearful meaning lurks within
    Her glance as it questions the eye of Me
    gone

    An awful meaning of guilt and sin
    The Indian hath opened his blanket and there
    Hangs a human scalp by its long damp hair
    With hand upraised witli quickdrawn breath
    She meets that ghastly sign of death
    In one long glassy spectral stare
    The enlarging eye is fastened there
    As if that mesh of pale brown hair

    Had power to change at sight alone
    Even as the fearful locks which wound
    Medusas fatal forehead round

    The gazer into stone
    With such a look Herodias read
    The features of the bleeding head
    So looked the mad Moor on his dead
    Or the young Cenci as slie stood
    Oerdabbled with a fathers blood

    Look   feeling melts that frozen glance
    It moves that marble countenance
    As if at once within her strove
    Pity with shame and hate with love
    The Past recalls its joy and pain
    Old memories rise before her brain
    The lips which loves embraces met
    The hand her tears of parting wet
    The voice whose pleading tones beguiled
    The pleased ear of the forestchild
    And tears she may no more repress
    Reveal her lingering tenderness

    Oh woman wronged can cherish hate

    More deep and dark than manhood may
    But when the mockery of Fate

    Hath left Revenge its chosen way
    And the fell curse which years have nursed
    Full on the spoilers head hath burst
    Wlien all her wrong and shame and pain
    Burns fiercely on his heart and brain
    Still lingers something of the spell

    Which bound her to the traitors bosom
    Still midst the vengeful fires of hell

    Some flowers of old affection blossom

    John Bonitons eyebrows together are drawn
    With a fierce expression of wrath and scorn
    He hoarsely whispers Ruth beware
    Is this the time to be playing the fool



    Crying over a paltry lock of hair

    Like a lovesick girl at school
    Curse on it   an Indian can see and hear
    Away  and prepare our evening cheer

    How keenly the Indian is watching now
    Her tearful eye and her varying brow

    With a serpent eye which kindles and burns
    Like a fiery star in the upper air
    On sire and daughter his fierce glance turns
    Has my old white father a scalp to spare
    For his young one loves the pale brown hair
    Of the scalp of an English dog far more
    Than Mogg Megone or his wigwam floor
    Go  Mogg is wise  he will keep his land
    And Sagamore John when he feels with his
    hand
    Shall miss his scalp where it grew before

    The moments gust of grief is gone

    The lip is clenched  the tears are still
    God pity thee Ruth Boniton
    With what a strength of will
    Are natures feelings in thy breast
    As with an iron hand repressed
    And how upon that nameless woe
    Quick as the pulse can come and go
    Vllile shakes the unsteadfast knee and yet
    The bosom heaves  the eye is wet
    Has thy dark spirit power to stay
    The hearts wild current on its way

    And whence that baleful strength of guile
    Wliich over that still working brow
    And tearful eye and cheek can throw

    The mockery of a smile
    Warned by her fathers blackening frown
    With one strong effort crushing down
    Grief hate remorse she meets again
    The savage murderers sullen gaze
    And scarcely look or tone betrays
    How the heart strives beneath its chain

    Is the Sachem angry  angry with Ruth
    Because she cries with an ache in her tooth
    Which would make a Sagamore jump and cry
    And look about with a womans eye
    No  Ruth will sit in the Sachems door
    And braid the mats for his wigwam floor
    And broil his fish and tender fawn
    And weave his wampum and grind his corn
    For she loves the brave and the wise and none
    Are braver and wiser than Mogg Megone

    The Indians brow is clear once more

    With grave calm face and halfshut eye
    He sits upon the wigwam floor

    And watches Ruth go by
    Intent upon her household care

    And ever and anon the while
    Or on the maiden or her fare
    Which smokes in grateful promise there

    Bestows his quiet smile



    Ah Mogg Megone   what dreams are thine
    But those which loves own fancies dress

    A wigwam where the warm sunshine
    Looks in among the groves of pine
    A stream where round thy light canoe
    The trout and salmon dart in view
    And the fair girl before thee now
    Spreading thy mat with hand of snow
    Or plying in the dews of morn
    Her hoe amidst thy patch of corn
    Or offering up at eve to thee
    Thy birchen dish of hominy

    From the rude board of Boniton

    Venison and succotash have gone

    For long these dwellers of the wood

    Have felt the gnawing want of food

    But untasted of Ruth is the frugal cheer

    With head averted yet ready ear

    She stands by the side of her austere sire

    Feeding at times the unequal fire

    With the yellow knots of the jjitehpine tree

    Whose flaring light as they kindle falls

    On the cottageroof and its black log walls

    And over its inmates three

    From Sagamore Bonitons hunting flask

    The firewater burns at the lip of Megone
    Will the Sachem hear what his father shall
    ask

    Will he make his mark that it may be known
    On the speakingleaf that he gives the land
    From the Sachems own to his fathers hand
    The firewater shines in the Indians eyes

    As he rises the white mans bidding to do
    Wuttamuttata  weekan  Mogg is wise

    For the water he drinks is strong and new
    Moggs heart is great   will he shut his hand
    When his father asks for a little land
    With unsteady fingers the Indian has drawn

    On the parchment the shape of a hunters
    bow
    Boon water  boon water  Sagamore John

    Wuttamuttata  weekan  our hearts will
    grow
    He drinks yet deeper he mutters low
    He reels on his bearskin to and fro
    His head falls down on his naked breast
    He struggles and sinks to a drunken rest

    Humph  drunk as a beast  and Boni
    tons brow

    Is darker than ever with evil thought
    The fool has signed his warrant  but how

    And when shall the deed be wrought
    Speak Ruth  why what the devil is there
    To fix thy gaze in that empty air
    Speak Ruth  by my soul if I thought that tear
    Which shames thyself and our purpose here
    Were shed for that cursed and palefaced dog
    Whose green scalp hangs from the belt of Mogg

    And whose beastly soul is in Satans keeping
    This  this    he dashes his hand upon
    The rattling stock of his loaded gun

    Should send thee with him to do thy weep



    Father    the eye of Boniton
    Sinks at that low sepulchral tone



    Hollow and deep as it were spoken
    By the unmoving tongue of death

    Or from some statues lips had broken
    A sound without a breath

    Father   my life I value less

    Than yonder fool his gaudy dress

    And how it ends it matters not

    By heartbreak or by rifieshot

    But spare awhile the scoff and threat

    Our business is not finished yet

    True true my girl  I only meant

    To draw up again the bow unbent

    Harm thee my Ruth  I only sought

    To frighten off thy gloomy thought

    Come  let s be friends   He seeks to clasp

    His daughters cold damp hand in his

    Ruth startles from her fathers grasp

    As if each nerve and muscle felt

    Instinctively the touch of guilt

    Through all their subtle sympathies

    He points her to the sleeping Mogg
    What shall be done with yonder dog
    Scamman is dead and revenge is thine
    The deed is signed and the land is mine
    And this drunken fool is of use no more
    Save as thy hopeful bridegroom and sooth
    T were Christian mercy to finish him Ruth
    Now while he lies like a beast on our floor
    If not for thine at least for his sake
    Rather than let the poor dog awake
    To drain my flask and claim as his bride
    Such a forest devil to run by his side
    Such a Wetuomanit as thou wouldst make

    He laughs at his jest Hush  what is there
    The sleeping Indian is striving to rise
    With his knife in his hand and glaring eyes

    Wagh   Mogg will have the palefaces liair
    For his knife is sharp and his fingers can help

    The hair to puU and the skin to peel

    Let himi cry like a woman and twist like an eel
    The great Captain Scamman must lose his
    scalp

    And Ruth when she sees it shall dance with
    Mogg

    His eyes are fixed  but his lips draw in

    With a low hoarse chuckle and fiendish grin
    And he sinks again like a senseless log

    Ruth does not speak  she does not stir
    But she gazes down on the murderer
    Whose broken and dreamful slumbers tell
    Too much for her ear of that deed of hell
    She sees the knife with its slaughter red
    And the dark fingers clenching the bearskin

    bed
    What thoughts of horror and madness whirl
    Through thfc burning brain of that fallen girl

    John Boniton lifts his gun to his eye

    Its muzzle is close to the Indians ear
    But he drops it again Some one may be
    I nigh

    He draws his knife from his deerskin belt
    Its edse with his fingers is slowly felt
    Kneeling down on one knee by the Indians

    side
    From his throat he opens the blanket wide
    And twice or thrice he feebly essays
    A trembling hand with the knife to raise

    I cannot  he mutters   did he not save
    My life from a cold and wintry grave
    When the storm came down from Agiochook
    And the northwind howled and the treetops

    shook
    And I strove in the drifts of the mshing snow
    Till my knees grew weak and I could not go

    In the Devils name tell me  what s to be

    done

    Oh when the soul once pure and high
    Is stricken down from Virtues sky
    As with the downcast star of morn
    Some gems of light are with it drawn
    And through its night of darkness play
    Some tokens of its primal day
    Some lofty feelings linger still

    The strength to dare the nerve to meet

    Whatever threatens with defeat
    Its allindomitable will
    But lacks the mean of mind and heart
    Though eager for the gains of crime
    Or at his chosen place and time
    The strength to bear his evil part
    And shielded by his very Vice
    Escapes from Crime by Cowardice

    Ruth starts erect  with bloodshot eye

    And lips drawn tiiht across her teeth

    But fitfully there the hearthfire burns

    And he sees on the wall strange shadows
    play
    A lifted arm a tremulous blade
    Are dimly pictured in light and shade

    Plunging down in the darkness Hark that
    cry
    Again  and again  he sees it fall

    He hears quick footsteps  a shape flits by
    The door on its rusted hinges creaks

    T IS morning over Norridgewock
    On tree and wigwam wave and rock
    Bathed in the autumnal sunshine stirred
    At intervals by breeze and bird



    And wearing all the hues which glow
    In heavens own jrtxre and perfect bow

    That glorious picture of the air
    Which summers lightrobed angel forms
    On the dark ground of fading storms

    Witli pencil dipped in sunbeams there
    And stretching out on either hand
    Oer all that wide and unshorn land
    Till weary of its gorgeousness
    The aching and the dazzled eye
    Rests gladdened on the calm blue sky

    Slumbers the mighty wilderness
    The oak upon the windy hill

    Its dark green burthen upward heaves
    The hemlock broods above its rill
    Its conelike foliage darker still

    Against the birchs graceful stem
    And the rough walnutbough receives
    The snn upon its crowded leaves

    Each ciiloied like a topaz gem

    And the tall maple wears with them
    The coronal which autumn gives

    The brief bright sign of ruin near

    The hectic of a dying year

    The hermit priest who lingers now

    On the Bald Mountains shrtibless brow

    The gray and tlnuidtTsniitten pile

    Which marks afar the DesiTt Isle
    While gazing on the scene below
    May half forget the dreams of home
    That nightly with his slumbers come
    The tranquil skies of sunny France
    The peasants harvest song and dance
    The vines around the hillsides wreathing
    The soft airs midst their clusters breathing
    The wings which dijped the stars which shone
    Within thy bosom blue Garonne
    And round the Abbeys shadowed wall
    At morning spring and evenfall

    Sweet voices in the still air singing
    The chant of many a holy hymn

    The solemn bell of vespers ringing
    And hallowed torchlight falling dim
    On pictured saint and seraphim
    For here beneath him lies unrolled
    Bathed deep in mornings flood of gold
    A vision gorgeous as the dream
    Of the beatified may seem

    When as his Churchs legends say
    Born upward in ecstatic bliss

    The rapt enthusiast soars away
    Unto a brighter world than this
    A mortals glimpse beyond the pale
    A moments lifting of the veil

    Far eastward oer the lovely bay
    Penobscots clustered wigwams lay
    And gently from that Indian town
    The verdant hiUside slopes adown
    To where the sparkling waters play

    Upon the yellow sands below
    And shooting round the winding shores

    Of narrow capes and isles which lie

    Slumbering to oceans lullaby
    With birchen boat and glancing oars

    While from their planting ground is borne

    The treasure of the golden corn

    By laughing girls whose dark eyes glow

    Wild through the locks whicli oer them flow

    The wrinkled squaw whose toil is done

    Sits on her bearskin in the sun

    Watching the buskers with a smile

    For each full ear which swells the pile

    And the old chief who nevennore

    May bend the bow or puU the oar

    Smokes giavely in his wigwam door

    Or slowly shapes with axe of stone

    The arrowhead from flint and bone

    Beneath the westward turning eye
    A thousand wooded islands lie
    Gems of the waters  with each hue
    Of brightness set in oceans blue
    Each bears aloft its tuft of trees

    Touched by the pencil of the frost
    And with the motion of each breeze
    A moment seen a moment lost
    Changing and blent confused and tossed
    The brighter with the darker crossed
    Their thousand tints of beauty glow
    Down in the restless waves below
    And tremble in the sunny skies
    As if from waving bough to bough

    Flitted the birds of paradise
    There sleep Placentias group and there
    Pre Breteaux marks the hour of prayer
    And there beneath the seaworn cUff

    On which the Fathers hut is seen
    The Indian stays his rocking skiff

    And peers the hemlockboughs between
    Half trembUng as he seeks to look
    Upon the Jesuits Cross and Book
    There gloomily against the sky
    The Dark Isles rear theii summits high
    And Desert Rock abrupt and bare
    Lifts its gray turrets in the air
    Seen from afar like some stronghold
    Built by the ocean kings of old
    And faint as smokewreath white and thin
    Swells in the north vast Katahdin
    And wandering from its marshy feet
    The broad Penobscot comes to meet

    And mingle with his own bright bay
    Slow sweep his dark and gathering floods
    Arched over by the ancient woods
    Which Time in those dim solitudes
    Wielding the dull axe of Decay i
    Alone hath ever shorn away

    Not thus within the woods which hide
    The beauty of thy azure tide

    And with their falling timbers block
    Thy broken currents Kennebec
    Gazes the white man on the wreck

    Of the downtrodden Norridgewock
    In one lone village hciiuiicd at kngth
    In battle shorn of half their strength
    Turned like the panther in his lair

    With his fastflowing hf eblood wet
    For one last struggle of despair

    Wounded and faint but tameless yet
    Unreaped upon the planting lands



    The scant neglected harvest stands

    No shout is there no dance no song
    The aspect of the very child
    Scowls with a meaning sad and wild

    Of bitterness and wrong
    The almost infant Norridgewock
    Essays to lift the tomahawk
    And plucks his fathers knife away
    To mimic in his frightful play

    The scalping of an English foe
    Wreathes on his lip a horrid smile
    Burns like a snakes his small eye while

    Some bough or sapling meets his blow
    The fisher as he drops his line
    Starts when he sees the hazels quiver
    Along the margin of the river
    Looks up and down the rippling tide
    And grasps the firelock at his side
    For Bomazeen from Tacconock
    Has sent his runners to Norridgewock
    With tidings that Moulton and Harmon of
    York

    Far up the river have come
    They have left their boats they have entered

    tlie wood
    And filled the depths of the solitude

    With the sound of the rangers drum

    On the brow of a hill which slopes to meet
    The flowing river and bathe its feet
    The barewashed rock and the drooping grass
    And the creeping vine as the waters pass
    A rude and unshapely chapel stands
    Built up in that wild by unskilled hands
    Yet the traveller knows it a place of prayer
    For the holy sign of the cross is there
    And should he chance at that place to be

    Of a Sabbath morn or some haUowed day
    Wlien prayers are made and masses are said
    Some for the Uving and some for the dead
    Well might that traveller start to see

    The tall dark forms that take their way
    From the birch canoe on the river shore
    And the forest paths to that chapel door
    And marvel to mark the naked knees

    And the dusky foreheads bending there
    While in coarse Avhite vesture over these

    In blessing or in prayer
    Stretching abroad his thin pale hands
    Like a shrouded ghost the Jesuit stands

    Two forms are now in that chapel dim
    The Jesuit silent and sad and pale
    Anxiously heeding some fearful tale
    Which a stranger is telling him
    That strangers garb is soiled and torn
    And wet with dew and loosely worn
    Her fair neglected hair falls down
    Oer cheeks with wind and sunshine brown
    Yet still in that disordered face
    The Jesuits cautious eye can trace
    Those elements of former grace
    Which half effaced seem scarcely less
    Even now than perfect loveliness

    With drooping head and voice so low
    That scarce it meets the Jesuits ears

    The tooth of pain was keenly preying

    Upon her very heart repaying
    My brief repentance with a smile

    Oh in her meek forgiving eye

    There was a brightness not of nurth
    A light whose clear intensity

    Was borrowed not of earth
    Along her cheek a deepening red
    Told where the feverish hectic fed

    And yet each fatal token gave
    To the mild beauty of her face
    A newer and a dearer grace

    Unwarning of the grave
    T was like the hue which Autumn gives
    To yonder changed and dying leaves

    Breathed over by his frosty breath
    Scarce can the gazer feel that this
    Is but the spoilers treacherous kiss

    The mockiugsmile of Death

    Sweet were the tales she used to teU

    When summers eve was dear to us
    And fading from the darkening dell
    The glory of the sunset fell

    On wooded Agamenticus
    When sitting by our cottage wall
    The murmur of the Saeos fall

    And the southwinds expiring sighs
    Came softly blending on my ear
    With the low tones I loved to hear

    Tales of the pure the good the wise
    The holy men and maids of old
    In the allsacred pages told



    Of Rachel stooped at Harans fomitains
    Amid her fathers thirsty flock
    Beautiful to her kinsman seeming
    As the bright angels of his dreaming

    On Padanaraus holy rock
    Of gentle Ruth and her who kept

    Her awful vigil on the mountains
    By Israels virgin daughters wept
    Of Miriam with her maidens singing

    The song for grateful Israel meet
    While every crimson wave was bringing

    The spoils of Egypt at her feet
    Of her Samarias humble daughter

    Who paused to hear beside her well

    Lessons of love and truth which feU
    Softly as Shilohs flowing water

    And saw beneath his pilgrim guise
    The Promised One so long foretold
    By holy seer and bard of old

    Revealed before her wondering eyes 1

    Slowly she faded Day by day
    Her step grew weaker in our haU
    And fainter at each evenfall

    Her sad voice died away
    Yet on her tliin pale lip the while
    Sat Resignations holy smile
    And even my father checked his tread
    And hushed his voice beside her bed
    Beneath the calm and sad rebuke
    Of her meek eyes imploring look
    The scowl of hate his brow forsook

    And in his stern and gloomy eye
    At times a few unwonted tears
    Wet the dark lashes which for years

    Hatred and pride had kept so dry

    Calm as a child to slumber soothed
    As if an angels hand had smoothed

    The still white features into rest
    Silent and cold without a breath

    To stir the drapery on her breast
    Pain with its keen and poisoned fang
    Tlie horror of the mortal pang
    The suftering look her brow had worn
    The fear the strife the anguish gone

    She slept at last in death

    Oh tell me father can the dead
    Walk on the earth and look on us

    And lay upon the livings head
    Tlieir blessing or their curse

    For oh last night she stood by me

    As I lay beneath the woodland tree

    The Jesuit crosses himself in awe

    Jesu  what was it my daughter saw

    She came to me last night

    The dried leaves did not feel her tread
    She stood by me in the wan moonlight

    In the white robes of the dead
    Pale and very mournfully
    She bent her light form over me
    I heard no sound I felt no breath
    Breathe oer me from that face of death
    Its blue eyes rested on my own

    Rayless and cold as eyes of stone

    Yet in their fixed unchanging gaze

    Something which spoke of early days

    A sadness in tlieir quiet glare

    As if loves smile were frozen there

    Came oer me with an icy thrill

    O God  I feel its presence still

    The Jesuit makes the holy sign

    How passed the vision daughter mine

    All dimly in the wan moonshine
    As a wreath of inist will twist and twine
    And scatter and melt into the light
    So scattering melting on my sight

    The pale cold vision passed
    But those sad eyes were fixed on mine

    Mournfully to the last

    God help thee daughter tell me why
    That spirit passed hefore thine eye

    Father I know not save it be
    That deeds of mine have summoned her
    From the unbreathing sepulchre

    To leave her last rebuke with me

    Ah woe for me  my mother died

    Just at the moment when 1 stood

    Close on the veige of womanhood

    A child in everything beside

    And when my wild heart needed most

    Her gentle counsels they were lost

    My father lived a stormy life
    Of frequent change and daily strife
    And  God forgive him  left his child
    To feel like him a freedom wild
    To love the red mans dwellingplace

    The birch boat on his shaded floods
    The wild excitement of the chase

    Sweeping the ancient woods

    The campfire blazing on the shore

    Of the still lakes the clear stream where

    The idle fisher sets his weir
    Or angles in the shade far more

    Than that restraining awe I felt
    Beneath my gentle mothers care

    When nightly at her knee I knelt
    With childhoods simple prayer

    There came a change The wild glad mood

    Of unchecked freedom passed
    Amid the ancient solitude
    Of unshorn grass and waving wood

    And waters glancing bright and fast
    A softened voice was in my ear
    Sweet as those lulling sounds and fine
    The hunter lifts his head to hear
    Now far and faint now full and near

    The murmur of the windswept pine
    A manly form was ever nigh
    A bold free hunter with an eye

    Whose dark keen glance had power to wake
    Both fear and love to awe and charm

    T was as the wizard rattlesnate
    Whose evil glances lure to harm
    Whose cold and small and glittering eye



    And brilliant coil and changing dye
    Draw step by step the gazer near
    With drooping wing and cry of fear
    Yet powerless all to turu away
    A conscious but a willmg prey

    Fear doubt thought life itself erelong
    Merged in one feeling deep and strong
    Faded the world which I had known

    A poor vain shadow cold and waste
    In the warm present bliss alone

    Seemed I of actual fife to taste
    Fond longings dimly understood
    The glow of passions quickening blood
    And cherished fantasies which press
    The young lip with a dreams caress
    The hearts forecast and prophecy
    Took form and life before my eye
    Seen in the glance which met my own
    Heard in the soft and pleading tone
    Felt in the arms around me cast
    And warm hcjirtpulses beating fast
    Ah  scarcely yet to God ahove
    With deeper trust with stronger love
    Has prayerful saint his meek heart lent
    Or cloistered mm at twilight bent
    Than I before a human shiine
    As mortal and as frail as mine
    With heart and soul and mind and form
    Knelt madly to a fellowworm

    Full soon upon that dream of sin
    An awfid light came bursting in
    The shrine was cold at which I knelt

    The idol of that shrine was gone
    A humbled tiling of shame and guilt

    Outcast and spurned and lone
    Wrapt in the shadows of my crime

    With withering heart and burning brain

    And tears that fell like fiery rain
    I passed a fearful time

    There came a voice  it checked the tear

    In heart and soul it wrought a change
    My fathers voice was in my earg

    It whispered of revenge
    A new and fiercer feeling swept

    All lingering tenderness away
    And tignr passions which had slept

    In childhoods better day
    Unknown unfelt arose at length
    In all their own demoniac strength

    A youthful warrior of the wild
    By words deceived by smiles beguiled
    Of crime the cheated instrument
    Upon our fatal errands went

    Through camp and town and wilderness
    He tracked his victim  and at last
    Just wlviu the tide of hate had passed
    And milder thoughts came warm and fast
    Exulting at my feet he cast

    The bloody token of success

    God  with what an awful power

    I saw the buried past uprise
    And gathei in a single hour

    Its ghostlike memories
    And then I felt alas  too late

    That underneath the mask of hate
    That shame and guilt and wrong had thrown
    Oer feelings which they might not own

    The hearts wild love had known no change
    And still that deep and hidden love
    With its first fondness wept above

    The victim of its own revenge
    There lay the fearful scalp and there
    The blood was on its pale brown hair
    I thought not of the victims scorn

    I thought not of his baleful guile
    My deadly wrong my outcist name
    The characters of sin and shame
    On heart and forehead drawn

    I onlj saw that victims smile
    The still green places where we met
    The moonlit branches dewy wet
    I only felt I only heard
    The greeting and the parting word
    The smile the embrace the tone which made

    An Eden of the forest shade

    And oh with what a loathing eye

    With what a deadly hate and deep
    I saw that Indian murderer lie

    Before me in his drunken sleep
    What though for me the deed was done
    And words of mine had sped him on
    Yet when he luurmured as he slept

    The horrors of that deed of blood
    The tide of utter madness swept

    Oer brain and bosom like a flood
    And father with this hand of mine

    Ha  what didst thou   the Jesuit cries
    Shuddering as smitten with sudden pain

    And shading with one thin hand his eyes
    With the other he makes the holy sign
    I smote him as I would a worm
    With heart as steeled with nerves as firm

    He never woke again

    Woman of sin and blood and shame
    Speak I would know that victims name

    Father she gasped a chieftain known
    As Sacos Sachem  Mogg Megone

    Pale priest  What proud and lofty dreams
    Wliat keen desires what cherished schemes
    What hopes that time may not recall
    Are darkened by that chieftains fall
    Was he not pledged by cross and vow

    To lift the hatchet of his sire
    And round his own the Churchs foe

    To light the avenging fire
    Who now the Tarrantine shall wake
    For thine and for the Churchs sake

    Who summon to the scene
    Of conquest and unsparing strife
    And vengeance dearer than his life

    The fierysouled Castine
    Three backward steps the Jesuit takes
    His long thin frame as ague shakes

    And loathing hate is in his eye
    As from his lips these words of fear



    Fall hoarsely on the maidens ear

    The soul that sinneth shall surely die

    She stands as stands the stricken deer
    Checked midway in the fearful chase

    When buists upon his eye and ear

    The gaunt gray robber baying near
    Between him and his hidingplace

    While still behind with yell and blow

    Sweeps Uke a storm the coming foe

    Save me O holy man   her cry
    Fills all the void as if a tongue
    Unseen from rib and rafter hung

    Thrilling with mortal agony

    Her hands are clasping the Jesuits knee
    And her eye looks f earfidly into his own

    Off woman of sin  nay touch not me
    With the fingers of blood  begone

    With a gesture of horror he spurns the form

    That writhes at his feet like a trodden worm

    Ever thus the spirit must

    Guilty in the sight of Heaven
    With a keener woe be riven

    For its weak and sinful trust

    In the strength of human dust
    And its anguish thrill afresh

    For each vain reliance given
    To the failing arm of flesh



    Ah weary Priest  with pale hands pressed

    On thy throbbing brow of pain
    Baifled in thy lifelong quest

    Overworn with toiling vain
    How ill thy troubled musings fit

    The holy quiet of a breast

    With the Dove of Peace at rest
    Sweetly brooding over it
    Thoughts are thine which have no part
    With the meek and pure of heart
    Undisturbed by outward things
    Resting in the heavenly shade
    By the overspreading wings

    Of the Blessed Spirit made
    Thoughts of strife and hate and wrong
    Sweep thy heated brain along
    Fading hopes for whose success

    It were sin to breathe a prayer
    Schemes which Heaven may never bless

    Fears which darken to despair
    Hoary priest  thy dream is done
    Of a hundred red tribes won

    To the pale of Holy Church
    And the heretic oerthrown
    And his name no longer known
    And thy weary brethren turning
    Joyful from their jears of mourning
    Twixt the altar and the porch
    Hark  what sudden sound is heard

    In the wood and in the sky
    Shriller than the scream of bird

    Than the trumpets clang more high
    Every wolfcave of the liills

    Forest arch and mountain gorge

    Rock and dell and river verge
    With an answering echo thiills
    Well does the Jesuit know that cry
    Which summons the Norridgewock to die
    And tells that the foe of his flock is nigh
    He listens and hears the rangers come
    With loud hurrah and jar of drum
    And hurrying feet for the chase is hot
    And the short sharp sound of rifle shot
    And taunt and menace  answered well
    By the Indians mocking cry and yell
    The bark of dogs  the squaws mad scream
    The dash of paddles along the stream
    The whistle of shot as it cuts the leaves
    Of the maples around the churchs eaves
    And the gride of hatchets fiercely thrown
    On wigwamlog and tree and stone
    Black with the grime of paint and dust

    Spotted and streaked with human gore
    A grim and naked head is thrust

    Withm the chapeldoor
    Ha  Bomazeen  In Gods name say
    What mean these sounds of bloody fray
    Silent the Indian points his hand

    To where across the echoing glen
    Sweep Harmons dreaded rangerband

    And Moid ton Avith his men
    Where are thy warriors Bomazeen
    Where are De Rouville and Castine
    And where the braves of Sawgas queen
    Let my father find the winter snow
    Which the sun drank up long moons ago
    Under the falls of Tacconock
    The wolves are eating the Norridgewock
    Castine with his wives lies closely hid
    Like a fox in the woods of Pemaquid
    On Sawgas banks the man of war
    Sits in his wigwam like a squaw
    Squando has fled and Mogg Megone

    Struck by the knife of Sagamore John
    Lies stiff and stark and cold as a stone

    Fearfully over the Jesuits face

    Of a thousand thoughts trace after trace

    Like swift cloudshadows each other chase

    One instant his fingers grasp his knife

    For a last vain struggle for cherished life

    The next he hurls the blade away

    And kneels at his altars foot to pray

    Over his beads his fingers stray

    And he kisses the cross and calls aloud

    On the Virgin and her Son

    For terrible thoughts his memory crowd

    Of evil seen and done
    Of scalps brought home by his savage flock
    From Casco and Sawga and Sagadahock

    In the Churchs service won

    No shrift the gloomy savage brooks

    As scowling on the priest he looks

    Cowesass  cowesass  tawhieh wessa seen

    Let my father look upon Bomazeen

    My fathers heart is the heart of a squaw

    But mine is so hard that it does not thaw

    Let my father ask his God to make

    A dance and a feast for a great sagamore
    When he paddles across the western lake



    With his dogs and his squaws to the spirits
    shore
    Cowesass  cowesass  tawhieh wessa seen
    Let my father die like Bomazeen

    Through the chapels narrow doors

    And through each window in the walls
    Round the priest and warrior pours

    The deadly shower of English balls
    Low on his cross the Jesuit f aUs
    While at his side the Norridgewock
    With failing breath essays to mock
    And menace yet the hated foe
    Shakes his scalptrophies to and fro

    Exultingly before tlieir eyes
    Till cleft and torn by shot and blow

    Defiant still he dies

    So fare all eaters of the frog
    Death to the Babylonish dog

    Down with the beast of Rome
    With shouts like these around the dead
    Unconscious on his bloody bed

    The rangers crowding come
    Brave men  the dead priest cannot hear
    The unfeeling taunt   the brutal jeer
    Spurn  for he sees ye not  in wrath
    The symbol of your Saviours death

    Tear from his deathgrasp in your zeal
    And trample as a thing accursed
    The cross he cherished in the dust

    The dead man cannot feel

    Brutal alike in deed and word

    With callous heart and hand of strife
    How like a fiend may man be made
    Plying the foul and monstrous trade

    Whose harvestfield is human life
    Wliose sickle is the reeking sword
    Quencliing with reckless hand in blood
    Sparks kindled by the breath of God
    Urging the deathless soul vmshriven

    Of open guilt or secret sin
    Before the bar of that pure Heaven

    The holy only enter in
    Oh by the widows sore distress
    The orphans wailing wretchedness
    By Virtue struggling in the accursed
    Embraces of polluting Lust
    By the fell discord of the Pit
    And the pained souls that people it
    And by the blessed peace which fills

    Tlie Paradise of God forever
    Resting on all its holy hills

    And flowing with its crystal river
    Let Christian hands no longer bear

    In triumph on his crimson car

    The foul and idol god of war
    No more the purple wreaths prepare
    To bind amid his snaky hair
    Nor Christian bards his glories tell
    Nor Christian tongues his praises swell

    Through the gunsmoke wreathing white
    Glimpses on the soldiers sight
    A thing of human shape I ween
    For a moment only seen

    T is springtime on the eastern hills
    Like torrents gush the summer rills
    s moss and dry dead leaves
    The bladed grass revives and hves
    Pushes the mouldering waste away
    For glimpses to the Airil day
    In kindly shower and sunshine bud
    The branches of the dull gray wood
    Out from its sunned and sheltered nooks
    The blue eye of the violet looks

    The southwest wind is warmly blowing
    And odors from the springing grass
    The pinetree and the sassafras

    Are with it on its errands going

    A band is marching through the wood
    Where roUs tlie Kennebec his flood
    The warriors of the wilderness
    Painted and in their battle dress
    And with them one whose bearded cheek
    And white and wrinkled brow bespeak

    A wanderer from the shores of France
    A few long locks of scattering snow
    Beneath a battered moiion flow
    And from the rivets of the vest
    Which girds in steel his ample breast

    The slanted sunbeams glance



    In the harsh outlines of his face
    Passion and sin have left their trace
    Yet save worn brow and thin gray hair
    No signs of weary age are there

    His step is firm his eye is keen
    Nor years in broil and battle spent
    Nor toil nor wounds nor pain have bent

    The lordly frame of old Castine

    No purpose now of strife and blood

    Urges the hoary veteran on
    The fiie of conquest and the mood

    Of chivalry have gone
    A mournful task is his  to lay

    Within tlie earth the bones of those
    Who perished in that fearfid day
    When Norridgewoek became the prey

    Of all unsparing foes
    Sadly and still dark thoughts between
    Of coming vengeance mused Castine
    Of the fallen chieftain Bomazeen
    Who bade for him the Norridgewocks
    Dig up their buried tomahawks

    For firm defence or swift attack
    And liim whose friendship formed the tie

    Wliieh held tile stern selfexile back
    From lapsing into savagery
    Whose garb and tone and kindly glance

    Recalled a younger happier day

    And prompted memory

    To bridge the mighty waste which lay

    Between his wild home and that gray
    Tall chateau of his native Franco
    Whose chapel bell with farheard din
    Ushered his birthhour gayly in
    And counted with its solemn toU
    s soul

    Hark  fi

    Suddeidy bursts the Indian yell
    For now on the very spot they stand

    Where the Norridgewocks fighting fell
    No wigwam smoke is curHng there
    The very earth is scorched and bare
    And they pause and listen to catch a sound

    Of breathing life  but there comes not one
    s bark and the rabbit

    THE PAST AND COMING YEAR

    Wave of an awful torrent thronging down
    With all tlie wealth of centuries and the cold
    erstrown
    With the great wrecks of empire and the old
    Magnificence of nations who are gone
    Thy last faint murmur  thy departing sigh
    Along the shore of being like a tone
    Thrilling on broken harpstrings or the swell
    Of the chained winds

    by
    And thou hast floated from the world of

    breath
    ermastering Death
    Thy pilot to eternity Farewell

    Go swell the throngful past Go blend with
    aU
    The garnered things of Death  and bear with

    thee
    The treasvires of thy pilgrimage the tall
    And beautiful dreams of Hope the ministry
    Of Love and high Ambition Man remains
    To dream again as idly  and the stains
    Of passion will be visible once more
    The winged spirit will not be confined
    By the experience of thy journey Mind
    Will struggle in its prisonhouse and still
    With Earth
    Unfurl tlie pinions fitted but to soar
    In that pure atmosphere where spirits range
    The liome of high existences  where change
    And blighting may not enter Love again
    Will bloom a fickle flower upon the grave
    ections  and Ambition wave
    His eagleplume most proudly for the rein
    Of Conscience will be loosened from the soul
    To give his purpose freedom The control
    Of reason will be changeful and the ties
    Which gather hearts together and make up
    The romance of existence will be rent
    Yea poison will be poured in Friendship
    s low familiar element
    Even Love itself forsake its kindred skies

    But not alone dark visions  happier things
    Will float above existence like the wings
    Of the starred bird of paradise  and Love
    Will not be all a dream or rather prove
    A dream  a sweet f orgetf ulness  that hath



    No wakeful changes ending but in Death
    Yea pure hearts shall be pledged beneath the

    eyes
    Of the beholding heaven and in the fight
    Of the lovehallowed moon The quiet Night
    Shall hear that language underneath the skies
    Which whispereth above them as the prayer
    And the deep vow are spoken Passing fair
    And gifted creatures with the light of truth
    And undebarred affection as a crown
    Resting upon the beautiful brow of youth
    Shall smile on stately manhood kneeling down
    Before them as to Idols Friendship
    ection
    Be sanctified with sympathy The bier
    Of stricken love shall lose the fears which

    Death
    Giveth his awful work and earnest Faith
    Shall look beyond the shadow of the clay
    The pulseless sepulchre the cold decay
    And to the quiet of the spiritland
    Follow the mourned and lovely Gifted ones
    Lighting the Heaven of Intellect fike suns
    iShall wrestle well with circumstance and bear
    The agony of scorn the preying care
    Wedded to burning bosoms  and go down
    In sorrow to the noteless sepulchre
    With one lone hope embiacing fike a crown
    The cold and deathlike forehead of Despair
    That after times shall treasure up their fame
    Even as a proud inheritance and high
    And beautiful beings love to breathe their name
    With the recorded things that never die

    And thou gray voyager to the breezeless sea
    Of infiinte Oblivion  speed thou on
    Another gift of time succeedeth thee
    Fresh from the hand of God  for thou hast done
    The errand of thy destiny  and none
    May dream of thy returning Go and bear
    s frail records to thy cold
    Eternal prisonhouse  the midnight prayer
    Of suffering bosoms and the fevered care
    Of worldly hearts  the miser
    s grasp at greatness the quenched

    light
    Of broken spirits  the forgiven wrong
    And the abiding curse  ay bear along
    These wrecks of thy own making Lo thy knell
    Gathers upon the windy breath of night
    Its last and faintest echo Fare thee weU



    THE MISSIONARY

    It is an awfnl an arduous thing to root out
    every aflection for earthly things so as to live
    only for another world I am now far very
    far from you all  and as often as I look around
    and see the Indian scenery I sigh to think of
    Letters of
    Henry Martyn from India

    Say whose is this fair picture which the light

    From the unshutterd window rests upon
    Even as a lingering halo  Beautiful

    The keen fine eyo of niiiiliiol and a lip
    Lovely as that of Ilylas and iniinssud
    With the bright signet of some brilliant thought
    That broad expanse of forehead clear and high
    Marked visibly with the characters of mind
    And the free locks around it raven black
    Luxuriant and unsilverd   who was he

    A friend a more than brother In the spring

    And glory of his being he went forth

    From the embraces of devoted friends

    From ease and quiet happiness from more

    From the warm heart that loved him with a love

    Holier than eartbly passion and to whom

    The beauty of his spirit shone above

    The charms of perishing nature He went forth

    Strengthened to suffer gifted to subdue

    The might of human passion to pass on

    Quietly to the sacrifice of all

    The lofty hopes of boyhood and to turn

    The high ambition written on that brow

    From its first dream of power and human fame

    Unto a task of seeming lowliness

    Yet GodHke in its purpose He went forth

    To bind the broken spirit to pluck back

    The heathen from the wheel of Juggernaut

    To place the spiritual image of a God

    Holy and just and true before the eye

    Of the darkminded Brahmin and unseal

    The holy pages of the Book of Life

    Fraught with sublimer mysteries than all

    The sacred tomes of Vedas to unbind

    The widow from her sacrifice and save

    The perishing infant from the worshipped river

    He slumbers well
    Beneath the shadow of an Indian palm
    There is no stone above his grave The wind
    Hot from the desert as it stirs the leaves
    Heavy and long above him sighs alone
    Over his place of slumber

    God forbid
    Nay not alone
    His God was with him in that last dread hour
    His great arm underneath him and His smile
    Melting into a spirit full of peace
    And one kind friend a human friend was

    near
    One whom his teachings and his earnest prayers
    Had snatch
    Felt the last pressure of his failing hand
    e
    And laid the green turf over him with tears
    And left him with his God

    And was it well
    Dear lady that this noble mind should cast
    Its rich gifts on the waters  That a heart
    Full of all gentleness and truth and love
    Should wither on the suicidal shrine
    Of a mistaken duty  If I read
    Aright the fine intelligence which fills
    That amplitude of brow and gazes out
    Like an indwelling spirit from that eye
    He might have borne him loftily among
    The proudest of his land and with a step



    Unfaltering ever steadfast and secure
    Gone up the paths of greatness  bearing still
    A sister spirit with him as some star
    Preeminent in Heaven leads steadily up
    A kindred watcher with its fainter beams
    Baptized in its great glory Was it well
    That aU this promise of the heart and mind
    Should perish from the earth and leave no

    trace
    Unfolding like the Cereus of the clime
    Which hath its sepulchre but in the night
    Of pagan desolation  was it well

    Thy will be done O Father   it was well
    Vllat are the honors of a perishing world
    Grasp
    Of tlie unthoughtful multitude which greets
    The dull ear of decay  the wealth that loads
    The bier with costly drapery and shines
    In tinsel on the coffin and builds up
    The cold substantial monument  Can these
    Bear up the sinking spirit in that hour
    When heart and flesh are failing and the grave
    Is opening under us 2 Oh dearer then
    The memory of a kind deed done to him
    Who was our enemy one grateful tear
    In the meek eye of virtuous suffering
    d up by unseen charity
    On the wan lips of hunger or one prayer
    Breathed from the bosom of the penitent
    The stain
    Our mild rebuke and tenderness of love
    d

    But lady say
    Did he not sometimes almost sink beneath
    The burden of his toil and turn aside
    To weep above his sacrifice and cast
    A sorrowing glance upon his childhoods home
    Still green in memory  Clung not to his heart
    Something of earthly hope uncrucified
    Of earthly thought unchastened  Did he bring
    Lifes warm affections to the sacrifice
    Its loves hopes sorrows  and become as one
    Knowing no kindred but a perishing world
    No love but of the sinendangered soul
    No hope but of the winning back to life
    Of the dead nations and no passing thought
    Save of the errand wlierewith he was sent
    As to a martyrdom

    Nay though the heart
    Be consecrated to the holiest work
    Vouchsafed to mortal effort there will be
    Ties of the earth around it and through all
    Its perilous devotion it must keep
    Its own humanity And it is well
    Else why wept He who with our nature veiled
    The spirit of a God o
    And the cold grave of Lazarus  And why
    In the dim garden rose his earnest prayer
    That from his lips the cup of suffering
    Might pass if it were possible

    My friend
    Was of a gentle nature and his heart
    Gushed like a riverfountain of the hills

    EVENING IN EURMAH

    A night of wonder  piled afar
    With ebon feet and crests of snow

    s peaks which bar

    The sunset and the sunset

    From half the shadowed vale below

    Volunied and vast the dense clouds lie

    And over them and down the sky
    Paled in the moon the lightnings go

    And what a strength of light and shade
    Is chequering all the earth below

    s verdant braid

    Of tangled vine and wild reed made
    What blossoms in the moonlight glow

    The Indian rose

    The ceiba with its crimson dress

    The twining myrtle dropped with snow

    And flitting in the fragrant air

    Or nestling in the shadowy trees
    A thousand brighthued birds are there
    Strange plumage quivering wild and rare

    With every faintly breathing breeze
    And wet with dew from roses shed
    The bulbul droops her weary head
    Forgetful of her melodies

    Uprising from the orangeleaves
    s turrets glow
    O
    Its verdant web the mjTtle Aveaves

    And hangs in flowering wreaths below
    And where the clustered palms eclipse
    The moonbeams from its marlile lips
    s silver waters flow

    Strange beauty fills the earth and air
    The fragrant grove and flowering tree

    And yet my thoughts are wandering where

    My native rocks lie bleak and bare
    A weary way beyond the sea

    The yearning spirit is not here

    It lingers on a spot more dear

    Than India

    Methinks I tread the wellknown street
    The tree my childhood loved is there



    Its bareworn roots are at my feet
    And through its open boughs I meet

    Wliite glimpses of the place of prayer
    And unforgotten eyes again
    Are glancing through the cottage pane

    s lustrous eyes more fair

    Oh holy haunts  oh childhood

    Where now my wandering heart is thine
    Here where the dusky heathen come
    To bow before the deaf and dumb

    Dead idols of their own design
    s tide
    The iirfant sinks and on its side

    The widow

    Here where raid light and song and flowers

    The priceless soul in ruin lies
    Lost dead to all those better powers
    Which link this fallen world of ours

    To Gods elearsliinmg Paradise
    And wrong and shame and hideous crime
    Are like the foliage of their clime

    The unshorn groAvth of centuries

    Turn then my heart  thy home is here

    No other now remains for thee
    The smile of love and friendship
    The tones that melted on thine ear

    The mutual thrill of sympathy
    The welcome of the household band
    The pressure of the lip and hand

    Thou mayst not hear nor feel nor see

    God of my spirit  Thou alone

    er my pillowed head
    Wliose ear is open to the moan
    And sorrowing of thy child hast known
    The grief which at my heart has fed
    The struggle of my soul to rise
    Above its earthborn sympathies
    The tears of many a sleepless bed

    Oh  be Thine arm as it hath been
    In every test of heart and faith
    The tempter
    s scoff the bosom sin

    A helper and a stay beneath
    A strength in weakness through the strife
    And anguish of my wasting life
    My solace and my hope in death

    LIFE
    OF WHITTIER

    THE HOMECOMING OF THE BRIDE

    The home of Sarah Greenleaf was upon the
    Newbury shore of the Merrimac nearly oppo
    site the home of the Whittiers The house
    was standing until a recent date Among Mr
    Whittiers papers was found the following frag
    ment of a ballad about the homecoming as
    a bride of his grandmother Sarah Greenleaf
    now first published

    Sarah Greenleaf of eighteen years

    Stepped lightly her bridegrooms boat within
    Waving midriver through smiles and tears

    A farewell back to her kith and kin
    With her sweet blue eyes and her new gold gown

    She sat by her stalwart lovers side
    Oh never was brought to HaverhiU town

    By land or water so fair a bride
    Glad as the glad autunmal weather

    The Indian summer so soft and warm
    They walked through the golden woods to
    gether

    His arm the girdle about her form

    They passed the dam and the gray gristmill

    Whose walls with the jar of grinding shook
    And crossed for the moment awed and stiU

    The haunted bridge of the Country Brook
    The great oaks seemed on Jobs Hill crown

    To wave in welcome their branches strong
    And an upland streamlet came rippling down

    Over root and rock like a bridal song
    And lo  in the midst of a clearing stood

    The roughbuilt farmhouse low and lone
    While all about it the unhewn wood

    Seemed drawing closer to claim its own

    But the red apples dropped from orchard trees
    The red cock crowed on the low fence rail

    From the garden hives came the sound of bees
    On the barn floor pealed the smiting flail

    Ho  all to the borders Vermonters come

    down 11

    With your breeches of deerskin and jackets of

    brown
    With your red woollen caps and your moccasins

    come
    To the gathering summons of trumpet and

    drum

    Come down with your rifles  Let gray wolf

    and fox
    Howl on in the shade of their primitive rocks

    On our south came the Dutchmen enveloped in

    grease
    And arming for battle while canting of peace
    On our east crafty Meshech has gathered his

    band
    To hang up our leaders and eat up our land

    Ho  all to the rescue  For Satan shall work
    No gain for his legions of Hampshire and York
    They claim our possessions  the pitiful

    knaves
    The tribute we pay shall be prisons and graves

    Let Clinton and Ten Broek with bribes in their

    hands
    Still seek to divide and parcel our lands

    Bark the wardogs of Britain aloud on the

    Let em come  what they can they are welcome

    to take

    What seek they among us  The pride of our

    wealth
    Is comfort contentment and labor and health
    And lands which as Freemen we only have

    trod
    Independent of all save the mercies of God

    Yet we owe no allegiance we bow to no throne
    Our ruler is law and the law is our own
    Our leaders themselves are our own fellowmen
    Who can handle the sword or the scythe or the
    pen

    Our wives are all true and our daughters are

    fair
    With their blue eyes of smiles and their light

    flowing hair
    All brisk at their wheels till the dark evenfall
    Then blithe at the sleighride the husking and

    baU

    We ve sheep on the hillsides we ve cows on
    the plain

    And gaytasselled cornfields and rankgrowing
    grain

    There are deer on the mountains and wood
    pigeons fly

    From the evaek of our muskets like clouds on
    the sky

    And there

    which take
    Their course from the hills to our broadbosomed

    lake



    Through rockarched Winooski the salmon leaps

    free
    And the portly shad follows all fresh from the

    sea

    Like a sunbeam the pickerel glides through the

    pool
    And the spotted trout sleeps where the water

    is cool
    Or darts from his shelter of rock and of root
    s quick plunge or the angler

    pursuit

    And ours are the mountains which awfully iise
    Till they lest their green heads on the blue of

    the skies
    And ours are the forests unwasted unshorn
    Save where the wild path of the tempest is torn

    And though savage and wild be this climate of

    ours
    And brief be our season of fruits and of flowers
    Far dearer the blast round our mountains which

    raves
    Than the sweet summer zephyr which breathes

    over slaves

    Hurrah for Vermont  For the land which we

    till
    Must have sons to defend her from valley and

    hill
    Leave the harvest to rot on the fields where it

    ALBUM VERSES

    Written in the album of May Pillsbury of
    West Newbury in the fall of I808 when
    Whittier was at home on a visit from Phila
    delphia where he was engaged in editorial
    work

    Pakdon a stranger hand that gives

    Its impress to these gilded leaves

    As one who graves in idle mood

    An idlers name on rock or wood

    So in a careless hour I claim

    A page to leave my humble name

    Accept it  and when oer my head

    A Pennsyivanian sky is sjMaad

    And but in dreams my eye looks back

    On broad and lovely Merrimac

    And on my ear no longer breaks

    The murmuring music which it makes

    When but in dreams I look again

    On Salisbury beach  Grasshopper plain

    Or Powow stream  or Amesbury mills

    Or old Crane neck or Pijiestave hiUs

    Think of me then as one who keeps

    Where Delawares broad current sweeps

    And down its rugged limestonebed

    The Schuylkills arrowy flight is sped

    Deep in his heart the scenes which grace

    native place

    Loves every spot to childhood dear

    untraveled

    Longs midst the Dutchmans kraut and greens

    For pumpkinpie and pork and beans

    And sighs to think when sweetly near

    The soft piano greets his ear

    That the fair hands whicli small and white

    Glance on its ivory polislicd liiht

    Have neer an Indian imddiug made

    Nor fashioned rye and Indian bread

    And oh  wheneer his footsteps turn

    Whatever stars above him burn

    Though dwelling where a Yankees name

    Is coupled with reproach or shame

    Still tru to liis New England birth

    Still faitliful to his home and hearth

    Even iiiidsf the scornful stranger band

    His boast shall be of Yankee Land

    The storm is rolling nearer

    Sound the onset wild and high

    Sound sound the trumpet fearlessly
    Each arm its vigor lending
    Bravely with wrong contending

    The Kansas homes stand cheerlessly
    The sky with flame is ruddy
    The prairie turf is bloody

    Where the brave and gentle die

    Should you go to Centre Harbor
    As haply you some time may

    Sailing up the Winnepesaukee
    From the hills of Alton Bay

    Into the heart of the liighlands

    Into the north wind free
    Through the rising and vanishing islands

    Over the mountain sea

    To the little hamlet lying

    White in its mountain fold
    Asleep by the lake and dreaming

    A dream that is never told

    s shadow
    Your pilgrim home you make

    Where the chambers open to sunrise
    The mountains and the lake

    If the pleasant picture wearies
    As the fairest sometimes will

    And the weight of the hills lies on you
    And the water is aU too stiU

    If in vain the peaks of Gunstock

    Redden with suiu
    And the sky and the purple mountains

    e

    If you turn from indoor thrumming
    And the clatter of bowls without

    And the folly that goes on its travels
    Bearing the city about

    And the cares you left behind you
    Come hunting along your track

    As BlueCap in German fable
    Rode on the traveller

    Let me tell you a tender story

    Of one who is now no more
    A tale to haunt like a spirit

    The Winnepesaukee shore

    Of one who was brave and gentle
    And strong for manly strife

    Riding with cheering and music
    Into the tourney of life

    Faltering and failing midway
    s subtle snare

    The chains of an evil habit
    He bowed himself to bear

    Over his fresh young manhood
    The bestial veil was flung

    The curse of the wiue of Circe
    The spell her weavers sung

    Yearly did hiU and lakeside

    Their summer idyls frame
    Alone in his darkened dwelling

    He hid his face for shame

    The music of life
    Sounded for him in vain

    APPENDIX



    The voices of human duty
    bniote on his ear like pain

    In vain over island and water
    The curtains of sunset swung

    In vain on the beautiful mountains
    The pictures of God were hung

    The wretched years crept onward

    Each sadder than the last
    All the bloom of life fell from him

    All the freshness and greenness past

    But deep in his heart forever

    And unprofaued he kept
    The love of his saintly mother

    Who in the graveyard slept

    His house had no pleasant pictures

    Its comfortless walls were bare
    But the riches of earth and ocean

    s chair

    The old chair quaintly carven
    With oaken arms outspread

    Whereby in the long gone twilights
    His childish prayers were said

    For thence in his long night watches

    By moon or starlight dim
    A face fidl of love and pity

    And tenderness looked on him

    And oft as the grieving presence

    Sat in his mother
    The groan of his self upbraiding

    Grew into wordless prayer

    At last in the moonless midnight
    The summoning angel came

    Severe in his pity touching

    The house Avith lingers of flame

    The red light flashed from its windows
    And flared from its sinking roof

    And baffled and aAved before it
    The villagers stood aloof

    They shrank from the falling rafters
    They turned from the furnace glare

    But its tenant cried  God help me
    s chair

    Under the blazing portal

    Over the floor of fire
    He seemed in the terrible splendor

    A martyr on his pyre

    In his face the mad flames smote him
    And stung him on either side

    But he clung to the sacred relic
    By his mothers chair he died

    mother with human yearnings

    O saint by the altar stairs
    Shall not the dear God give thee

    The child of thy many prayers



    Christ  by whom the loving
    Tliough erring are fcngiven

    Hast thou for liim no refuge
    No quiet place in heaven

    Give palms to thy strong martyrs
    And crown thy saints with gold

    But let the mother welcome
    Her lost one to thy fold



    LETTER TO LUCY LARCOM

    25th 3d mo 1866

    Believe me Lvicy Larcom it gives me real

    sorrow
    That I cannot take my carpetbag and go to

    town tomorrow
    snowbound

    like layers of an onion
    Have piled my back and weighed me down as

    with the pack of Bunyan
    The northeast wind is damper and the north
    west wind is colder
    Or else the matter simply is that I am growing

    older
    And then I dare not trust a moon seen over ones

    left shoulder
    As I saw this with slender horns caught in a

    west hillpine
    As on a Stamboul minaret curves the archim
    postors sign

    shapes your steps delay

    and goddess please you

    Whose lives with Calvins fiverailed creed have

    been so tightly walled in
    Should quit your Puritan homes and take the

    pains to go

    MRS CHOATES HOUSEWARMING

    His washerwoman Mrs Choate by indus
    try and thrift had been enabled to build for
    her family a comfortable house When it was
    ready for occupancy there was a housewarm
    ing attended by all the neighbors who brought
    substantial tokens of their goodwill including
    all the furniture needed in her new parlor
    Mr Whittier
    whole movement  he was present at the festiv
    ity and made a little speech congratulating
    Mrs Choate upon her welldeserved success in
    life and said he would read a piece of machine
    poetry which had been intrusted to him for the
    occasion These are the lines whicli were of
    S T PiCK
    ARD Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whit
    tier

    Of rights and of wrongs
    Let the feminine tongues

    Talk on  none forbid it
    Our hostess best knew
    What her hands found to do

    Asked no questions but did IT

    Here the lesson of work
    Which so many Jolks shirk

    Is so plain all may learn it
    Each brick in this dwelling
    Each timber is telling

    If you want a home EARN it



    The question of labor

    Is solved by our neighbor

    The old riddle guessed out
    The wisdom sore needed
    Tiie truth long unheeded

    Her flatiron

    Thanks then to Kate Choate
    Let the idle take note

    What their fingers were made for
    She cheerful and jolly
    Worked on late and early

    And bought  what she paid for

    Never vainly repining
    Nor begging nor whining

    The morningstar twinkles
    s lighter
    As she makes the world whiter

    And smooths out its wrinkles

    So long life to Kate
    May her heirs have to wait

    TiU they
    And lier flatiron press on
    Still teaching its lesson

    Of brave independence

    ery of Quincy 111 who revisited Whittier in

    1868

    The years that since we met have flown
    Leave as they found me still alone
    No wife nor child nor grandchild dear
    Are mine the heart of age to cheer
    More favored thou with hair less gray
    Than mine canst let thy fancy stray
    To where thy little Constance sees
    The prairie ripple in the breeze
    For one like her to lisp thy naine

    A FAREWELL

    Written for Mr and Mrs Claflin as they
    were about to sail to Europe

    What shall I say dear friends to whom I owe
    The choicest blessings dropping from the hands

    f trustful love and friendship as you go
    Forth on your journey to tliose older lands
    By saint and sage and bard and hero trod
    Scarcely the simple farewell of the Friends
    Sufficeth  after you my full heart sends
    Such benediction as the pilgrim heais
    Where the Greek faith its golden dome uprears
    From Crimeas roses to Archangel snows

    ON A FLYLEAF OF LONGFELLOWS
    POEMS

    Written at the Asquam House in the sum
    mer of 1882

    Hushed now the sweet consoling tongfiie
    Of him whose lyre the Mvises strung
    His last low swansong has been sung

    His last  And ours dear friend is near
    As clouds that rake the mountains here
    We too shall pass and disappear

    Yet howsoever changed or tost
    Not even a wreath of mist is lost
    No atom can itself exhaust

    So shall the souls superior force
    Live on and run its endless course
    In Gods unlimited universe

    And we whose brief reflections seem

    To fade like clouds from lake and stream

    Shall brighten in a holier beam

    Like that ancestral judge who bore his name
    Faithful to Freedom and to Truth he gave

    When all the air was hot with wrath and blame
    His youth and manhood to the fettered slave

    And never Woman in her sufFering saw
    A helper tender wise and brave as he

    Lifting her burden of unrighteous law
    He shamed the breast of ancient chivalry

    Noiseless as light that melts the darkness is
    He wrouglit as duty led and honor bid

    No trumpet heralds victories like his
    The unselfish worker in his work is hid

    What shall I wish him  Strength and health
    May be abused and so may wealth
    Even fame itself may come to be
    But wearying notoriety

    Wliat better can I ask than this
    A life of brave unselfishness
    Wisdom for council eloquence
    For Freedoms need for Truths defence
    The championship of all that s good
    The manliest faith in womanhood
    The steadfast friendship changing not
    With change of time or place or lot
    Hatred of sin but not the less
    A heart of pitying tenderness
    And charity that suffering long
    Shames the wrongdoer from his wrong
    One wish expresses all  that he
    May even as his grandsire be



    A DAYS JOURNEY

    Written in 1886 for the tenth anniversary
    of the wedding of his niece

    After your pleasant morning travel

    You pause as at a wayside inn
    And take with grateful hearts your breakfast

    Thoiigh served in dishes all of tin

    Then go while years as hours are counted

    Until the dials hand at noon
    Invites you to a dinner table

    Garnished with silver fork and spoon

    And when the vesper bell to supper

    Is calling and the day is old
    May love transmute the tin of morning

    And noondays silver into gold

    The dreadful burden of our sins we feel

    The pain of wounds which Thou alone canst

    heal
    To whom our weakness is our strong appeal

    From the black depths the ashes and the dross
    tf our waste lives we reach out to Thy cross
    And by its fullness measure all our loss

    That holy sign reveals Thee  throned above
    Xo Moloch sits no false vindictive Jove
    Thou art our Father and Thy name is Love  1

    Moulton and his wife by a parson Milton or

    could allay their terror  and one Mrs Williams
    the housekeeper persisted so strongly that she
    frequently saw them both he in a snuff colored
    suit and enormous wig holding a goldheaded
    cane that nothing could induce them to remain

    New England published in LS47 Mr Whittier
    relates the legend of the ancient house  Gen

    venge it is said by the fiend whom the former
    had outwitted He had agreed it seems to
    furnish the general with a boot full of gold and
    silver poured annually down the chimney The
    slirewd Yankee cut off on one occasion the foot
    of the boot and the Devil kept pouring down
    the coin from the chimney top in a vain at
    tempt to fin it until the room was literally
    packed with the precious metal WTien the
    general died he was laid out and put in a coffin
    as usual  but on the day of the funeral it was
    whispered about that his body was missing
    and the neighbors came to the charitable con
    clusion that the enemy had got his own at

    dance water to burn etc He was undoubt
    edly one of those shrewd and powerful men
    whose achievements are always regarded by a
    barbarous people as the result of supernatural
    aid The Indians gave to such the names of
    Powahs or Panisees

    Dr Hooker who accompanied Sir James
    Ross in his expedition of 1841 thus describes
    the appearance of that unknown land of frost
    and fire which was seen in latitude 77° south
    a stupendous chain of mountains the whole
    mass of which from its highest point to the
    ocean was covered with everlasting snow and
    ice

    The water and the sky were both as blue
    or rather more intensely blue tlian I have ever
    seen them in tlie tropics and all the coast was
    one mass of dazzlingly beautiful peaks of snow
    wliich wlien the sun approached the horizon re
    flected the most brilHant tints of golden yellow
    and scarlet  and then to see the dark cloud of
    smoke tinged with flame rising from the vol
    cano in a perfect unbroken column one side
    jetblack the other giving back the colors of
    the sun sometimes turning ofF at a right angle
    by some current of wind and stretching many
    miles to leeward  This was a sight so surpass
    ing everything that can be imagined and so
    heightened by the consciousness that we had
    penetrated under the guidance of our com
    mander iiit regions far beyond what was ever
    deemed practicable that it caused a feeling of
    awe to steal over us at the consideration of our
    own comparative insignificance and helpless
    ness and at the same time an indescribable
    feeling of the greatness of the Creator in the
    works of his hand

    Page 59 Here is the place

    The place Whittier liad in mind was his
    birthplace There were beehives on the gar
    den terrace near the wellsweep occupied per
    haps by the descendants of Thomas Whittiers
    bees The approach to the house from over
    the northern shoulder of Jobs Hill by a path
    that was in constant use in his boyhood and
    still in existence is accurately described in the
    poem The  gap in the old wall  is still to be
    seen and  the stepping stones in the shallow
    brook  are still in use His sisters garden was
    down by the brookside in front of the house
    and lier daffodils are perpetuated and may now
    be found in their season each year in that place
    The redbarred gate the poplars the cattle
    yard with  the white horns tossing above the
    wall were all part of Whittiers boy life on the
    old farm Even the touch of  the sundowns
    blaze on her window pane  is realistic The
    only place from which the blaze of the setting
    sun could be seen reflected in the windows of
    the old mansion is from the path so perfectly

    who reviving in the seventeenth century the
    spiritual faith and worship of Tauler and the
    Friends of God  in the fourteenth gathered
    about the pastor Spener and the young and
    beautiful Eleonora Johanna Von Merlau In

    The companys agent in the New World was
    a rising young lawyer Francis Daniel Pastorius
    son of Judge Pastorius of AViiidshchu who at
    the age of seventeen entered the University of
    Altorf He studied law at Strasburg Basle
    and Jena and at liatisbou the seat of the Im
    perial Government obtained a practical know
    ledge of international polity Successful in all
    his examinations and disputations he received
    the degree of Doctor of Law at Nuremberg in
    1U76 In ltJ79 he was a lawlecturer at Frank

    teachings of Dr Spener In 108081 he trav
    elled in France England Ireland and Italy
    with his friend Herr Von Rodeck  I was
    he says glad to enjoy again the company of
    my Christian friends rather than be with Von

    company with a small number of German
    Friends he emigrated to America settling
    upon the Frankfort Companys tract between
    the Schuylkill and the Delaware rivers The
    township was divided into four hamlets namely
    Germantown Krishelni Crefield and Sommer
    liausen JSoon after his arrival he united him
    self with the Society of Friends and became
    one of its most able and devoted members as
    well as the recognized head and lawgiver of the
    settlement He married two years after his
    arrival Anneke Anna daughter of Dr Klos
    terman of Muhlheim

    In the year 1S8 he drew up a memorial
    against slaveholding which was adopted by
    the Germantown Friends and sent up to the
    Monthly Meeting and thence to the Yearly
    Meeting at Philadelphia It is noteworthy as
    the first protest made by a religipns body
    against Negro Slavery The original document
    was discovered in 1844 by the Piiiladelphia an
    tiquarian Nathan Kite and published in The
    Friend Vol XVIII No lj It is a bold and
    direct appeal to the best instincts of the heart

    right to fight for their freedom as you liave to
    keep them slaves

    Unddr the wise direction of Pastorius the
    Germantown settlement giew and irospered
    The inhabitants planted orchards and vine
    yards and surrounded themselves with souve
    nirs of their old home A large number of them
    were linenweavers as well as small farmers
    The Quakers were the principal sect but men
    of all religions were tolerated and lived to
    gether in harmony In liit2 Richard Frame
    published in what he called verse a Descrip

    Which is at least in length one mile or more

    Chief Justice Logan Thomas Story and other

    own religious society as also with Kelpius the
    learned Mystic of the Wissahickon with the
    pastor of the Swedes church and the leaders
    of the Mennonites He wrote a description of

    many unpublished manuscripts covering a very

    lost One huge manuscript folio entitled Hive
    Beestock Meltiotropheum Alucar or Husca
    Apium still remains containing one thousand
    pages with about one hundred lines to a page
    It is a medley of knowledge and fancy history
    philosophy and poetry written in seven lan

    No tombstone not even a record of burial
    indicates where his remains have found their
    last restingplace and the pardonable desire to
    associate the homage due to this distinguished

    interred in any other place than the Friends
    old buryingground in Germantown though the
    fact is not attested by any definite source of in
    formation After all this obliteration of the
    last trace of his earthly existence is but typical
    of what has overtaken the times which he rep
    resents  that Germantown which he founded

    pilgrims of Pennsylvania seeking the same ob
    ject by different means have not been equally
    fortunate The power of their testimony for
    truth and holiness peace and freedom enforced
    only by what Milton calls the unresistible
    might of meekness has been felt through two
    centuries in the amelioration of penal severi
    ties the abolition of slavery the reform of the
    erring the relief of the poor and suffering
    felt in brief ui every step of human progress
    But of the men themselves with the single ex
    ception of WilHam Penn scarcely anything is
    known Contrasted from the outset Avith the
    stern aggressive Puritans of New England
    they have come to be regarded as  a feeble
    folk with a personality as doubtful as their
    unrecorded graves They were not soldiers
    like Miles tStandish  they had no figure so pic
    turesque as Vane no leader so rashly brave and
    haughty as Eudicott No Cotton Matlier wrote
    their Magnalia  they had no awful drama of
    supernaturalism in which tSatan and his angels
    were actors  and the only witch mentioned in
    their simple annals was a poor old Swedish
    woman who on complaint of her country
    women was tried and acquitted of everjthing
    but imbecility and folly Nothing but common
    place offices of civility came to pass between
    them and the Indians  indeed their enemies
    taunted thein with the fact that the savages
    did not regard them as Christians but just
    such men as tliemselves Yet it must be appar
    ent to every careful observer of the progress
    of American civihzation that its two principal
    currents had their sources in the entirely op
    posite directions of the Puritan and Quaker
    colonies To use the words of a late writer  i
    The historical forces with which no others
    may be compared in their influence on the peo
    ple have been those of the Puritan and the
    Quaker The strength of the one was in the
    confession of an invisible Presence a righteous
    eternal Will which would establish righteous
    ness on earth  and thence arose the conviction
    of a direct personal responsibility which could
    be tempted by no eternal splendor and could be
    shaken by no internal agitation and could not
    be evaded or transferred The strength of the
    other was the witness in the human spirit to an
    eternal Word an Inner Voice which spoke to
    each alone while yet it spoke to every man  a
    Light which each was to follow and which yet
    was tlie light of the world  and all other voices
    were silent before this and the solitary path
    whither it led was more sacred than the worn
    ways of cathedralaisles

    It will be sufficiently apparent to the reader
    that in the poem which follows I have at
    tempted nothing beyond a study of the life and
    times of the Pennsylvania colonist  a simple
    picture of a noteworthy man and his locality
    The colors of my sketch are all very sober
    toned down to the quiet and dreamy atmos
    phere through which its subject is visible
    Whether in the glare and tunmlt of the pres

    ent time such a picture will find favor may
    well be questioned I only know that it has
    beguiled for me some hours of weariness and
    that whatever may be its measure of public
    appreciation it has been to me its own reward

    ing the Hymn for the Memorial Church at

    has sole reference to the tribute of a brother
    and sister to the memory of a departed mother
    a tribute which seemed and still seems to
    him in itself considered very beautiful and ap
    propriate  but lie has since seen with surprise
    and sorrow a letter read at the dedication im
    posing certain extraordinary restrictions upon
    the society which is to occupy the house It is
    due to himself as a simple act of justice to say I



    that had he known of the existence of that let
    ter previously the Hynm would never have been
    written nor his name in any way connected
    with the proceedings   The restrictions imposed
    were designed to prevent the use of the build
    ing for any lecture or discussion on political
    subjects or other matters inconsistent with the
    preaching of the gospel

    it was published he received a curious letter
    from Mr Benjamin Corydon of Napoli N Y

    wrote

    The Palatine was a ship that was driven
    upon Block Island in a storm more than a

    ashore and were on their knees tliinkiiiir God
    for saving them from drowning when the Island
    ers rushed upon them and murdered them all
    That was a little more than the Almighty could

    let them know He had not forgotten their wick

    never after all were dead I must have seen

    she was last seen My father lived right oppo

    then she would disappear She resembled a

    Chalkleys own narrative of this incident as
    given in his Journal is as follows   To stop
    their murmuring I told them they should not
    need to cast lots which was usual in such cases
    which of us should die first for I would freely
    offer up my Ufa to do them good One said
    God bless you  I will not eat any of you
    Another said  He would die before he would
    eat any of me and so said several I can
    truly say on that occasion at that time my life
    was not dear to me and that I was serious and
    ingenuous in my proposition  and as I was lean
    ing over tlie side of the vessel thoughtfully con
    sidering my proposal to the company and look
    ing in my mind to Him that made me a very
    large dolphin came up towards the top or sur
    face of the water and looked me in the face
    and I called the people to put a hook into the
    sea and take him for here is one come to re
    deem me I said to them And they put a
    hook into the sea and the fish readily took it
    and they caught him He was longer than
    myself I think he was about six feet long
    and the largest that ever I saw This plainly
    showed us that we ought not to distrust the
    providence of the Almighty The people were
    quieted by this act of Providence and mur
    mured no more We caught enough to eat

    fant with them The woman went to the spring
    to get water leaving the man in charge of the
    child with many cautions to take good care of
    it When she arrived at the spring she found
    it dried up and went further to look for an
    other The husband alarmed at her long ab
    sence left the child and went in search When
    they returned the child was gone  and to their
    repeated eiies as they wandered through the
    woods in search they could get no response save
    the wailing cry of this little bird heard for the
    first time whose notes their anxious and excited
    imagination syllabled into papa mama the
    present Quichua name of the bird I suppose

    The origin of this jjoem is explained in the

    When my oldest daughter was two and a
    half years old she knew Whittiers Barefoot
    Boy hy heart thus when I would repeat it to
    her the omission of a line would be instantly cor
    rected as one day she said to me  Mamma
    you skipted out  apples of Cusperides  Once
    in going ahead of me in a dark hall she turned
    with sudden fear and said  Mamma take
    hold of my hand so it will not be so dark
    This incident and the fact of her affection for
    Mr Whittiers poetry was reported to him by
    a friend of the family My surprise and delight
    were great when in April lSiS4 I received a
    kind letter from the poet and a manuscript
    copy of the poem which was afterward pub
    lished in the Christmas number of St Nicho
    las In his letter Mr Whittier said  I am
    glad to have such a friend in thy little girl

    Mogg Megone or Hegone was a leader among
    the Saeo Indians in the bloody war of 1177
    He attacked and captured the garrison at Black
    Point October 12th of that year  and cut off
    at the same time a party of Englishmen near
    Saeo River From a deed signed by this Indian
    in lj64 and from other circumstances it seems
    that previous to the war he had mingled much
    with the colonists On this account he was

    bebastian Ralle established himself some
    time about the year 1670 at Norridgewock
    where he continued more than forty years He
    was accused and perhaps not without justice
    of exciting his Praying Indians against the Eng
    lish whom he looked upon as the enemies not
    only of his king but also of the Catholic reli
    gion He was killed by the English in 1724 at
    the foot of the cross which his own hands had
    planted His Indian church was broken up
    and its members either killed outright or dis
    persed

    In a letter written by Ralle to his nephew he
    givss the following account of his church and
    his own labors All my converts repair to
    the church regidarly twice every day  first
    very early in the morning to attend mass and
    again in the evening to assist in the prayers at
    sunset As it is necessary to fix the imagina
    tion of savages whose attention is easily dis
    tracted I have composed prayers calculated to
    inspire them with just sentiments of the august
    sacrifice of our altars  they chant or at least
    recite them aloud during mass Besides
    preaching to them on Simdays and saints days
    I seldom let a workingday pass without mak
    ing a concise exliortation for the purpose of
    inspiring them with horror at those vices to
    which they are most addicted or to confirm
    them in the practice of some particiUarvirtyie

    The character of Ralle has probably never
    been correctly delineated By his brethren of
    the Romish Cluirch he has been nearly apo
    theosized On the other hand our Puritan his
    torians have represented him as a demon in
    human form He was undoubtedly sincere in
    his devotion to the interests of his church and
    not overscrupulous as to the means of advan
    cing those interests  The French says the
    author of the History of Saco and Biddeford
    after the peace of 17i secretly promised to
    supply the Indians with arms and amunition if
    they would renew hostilities Their principal
